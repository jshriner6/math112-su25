Course Communication  E-mail is the best way to contact me for personal requests. You can expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays which either answers your question, or to set up a further meeting to discuss your request. You, in turn, are also expected to check your university email and our Canvas course regularly and respond in a timely manner.    Course Prerequisites  This course has no required prerequisites.    Course Textbook and Materials  This course has no required textbook, though the content organization is modeled after the text Mathematics for Sustainability , which can be downloaded for free using your Colorado State University login credentials. You will be asked to reference this text for case studies , and you may find it useful as a supplemental resource.  We will use Canvas to organize grades. The link to the text you are currently reading can be found in our Canvas course. We will utilize Doenet for section checkpoint questions after each course activity . Both Canvas and Doenet can be accessed using your Colorado State University email.  We are invested in making all course materials as accessible as possible. If you experience any barriers to access, please communicate with me so that we can make improvements.    Course Content and Structure  The first segment of our course will establish a broad range of mathematical tools which can be useful for analyzing questions in sustainability. We do so in six sub-contexts which describe the actions that math can help us perform or model: measuring, flowing, connecting, changing, risking, and deciding.  The second segment of the course is spent applying and extending these tools through 3 student-directed case studies.  The course structure emphasizes active learning and a collaborative work environment, which is outlined in more detail in our expectations document .     Assignments and Assessments   Activities  The first segment of class will be spent exploring content through in-class group activities, which are provided in this text. Activities contain examples, important definitions, practice problems, and concept questions to help you actively engage with the material. You will receive credit for completing the activities, responding to prompts in an individual portfolio, and participating in group and class discussions. Detailed expectations are outlined in our expectations document .    Case Studies  The second segment of class will be spent reviewing, preparing, and presenting case studies on topics in sustainbility. Case studies will be completed in groups, and you will be given guidelines that encourage you to use and expand on tools that were learned in the first segment of the course. There will be a total of three case studies, graded out of points each. A detailed rubric is provided in .    (Optional) Pre-Calculus Placements  The course does not serve as a prerequisite into any other math course. However, if you would like to earn placement out of specific pre-calculus courses, you will be given the opportunity to do so. At the beginning of the course, you will be asked to set any placement goals that you have for the semester. It will be your responsibility to study the relevant material for your goals outside of class, and visit office hours to practice and ask questions. We will then have two opportunities for you to take placement assessments: once between the first and second segments of our course, and once after the second segment of our course (finals week).    Tentative Schedule  Below is a tentative schedule for our course.           8 Weeks  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday    Week 1  Introduction\/Begin Section 1.1  Finish Section 1.1\/Section 1.2  Section 1.3\/Begin Section 2.1  Holiday: no class    Week 2  Finish Section 2.1\/Section 2.2  Section 2.3\/Begin Section 2.4  Finish Section 2.4\/Section 3.1  Section 3.2\/Begin Section 4.1    Week 3  Finish Section 4.1\/Section 4.2  Section 4.3\/Begin Section 4.4  Finish Section 4.4\/Section 4.5  Section 5.1\/Begin Section 5.2    Week 4  Finish Section 5.2\/Section 5.3  Section 5.4\/Begin Section 6.1  Finish Section 6.1\/Section 6.2  Section 6.3\/Introduction to Case Studies    Week 5  Placement Assessments  Placement Assessments  Case Study 1: Group\/Topic Selection\/Begin Outlines  Case Study 1: Finish Outlines\/Drafts    Week 6  Case Study 1: Finalize  Case Study 1: Begin Presentations  Case Study 1: Finish Presentations\/Case Study 2: Group\/Topic Selection  Case Study 2: Outlines\/Begin Drafts    Week 7  Case Study 2: Finish Drafts\/Finalize  Case Study 2: Begin Presentations  Case Study 2: Finish Presentations\/Case Study 3: Group\/Topic Selection  Case Study 3: Outlines\/Begin Drafts    Week 8  Case Study 3: Finish Drafts\/Finalize  Case Study 3: Begin Presentations  Case Study 3: Finish Presentations\/Placement Assessments  Placement Assessments       Letter Grades  Letter grades will be assigned according to the table below.

For example, a student who completes activities and has a total case study score of points would earn a C .         Letter Grades  A  B  C  F    Activities Completed        Case Study Total           Course and University Policies   Basic Needs Security  Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing can receive support from the Rams Against Hunger program . Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which are described and linked. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are comfortable in doing so.    Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion  Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at the catalog and at the SRC .  We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.  Here are several resources that highlight the past and current contributions to the mathematics community from underrepresented groups:   Meet A Mathematician    Mathematically Gifted and Black    Lathisms    Indigenous Mathematicians    Spectra    Association for Women in Mathematics    Mathematicians of the African Diaspora       Accommodation for Disabilities  If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class due to a disability or chronic health condition, I will need an accommodation letter from the Student Disability Center (SDC) before they are implemented. Please meet with me during my office hours to give me the letter and\/or to further discuss your needs.  If you do not already have these letters, please contact the SDC as soon as possible to initiate the accommodation process. The SDC is located in room 121 of the TILT building. Contact them at 970-491-6385 or visit the SDC website .    Student Parents\/Guardians\/Caregivers  I realize that student parents\/guardians and caregivers face distinctive challenges in succeeding academically, and I'm committed to supporting those of you who are parents to achieve our course's learning outcomes. If you encounter challenges in meeting course expectations, please contact me as soon as possible. We'll develop a plan together so you can be successful in the course.    Student Case Management   Student case management is available to help students with extenuating life circumstances and connect them with resources. In some cases, after you and I discuss your situation, I may request verifiable documentation for class absences from the SCM office if you request considerations for absences or missed coursework.    Mental Health and Wellness  CSU is a community that cares. You are not alone. CSU Health Network Counseling Services has trained professionals who can help. Your student fees provide access to a wide range of support services. Call Counseling Services at (970) 491-6053, and they will work together with you to find out which services are right for you. Visit counseling services to learn more and mental health resources for additional student mental health and well-being resources. If you are concerned about a friend or peer, use Tell Someone by c alling (970) 491-1350 or visiting Tell Someone to share your concerns with a professional who can discreetly connect the distressed individual with the proper resources. Rams Take Care of Rams. Reach out and ask for help if you or someone you know is having a difficult time.    Religious Observances and Class Attendance  CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at the catalog .    Discrimination and Harassment  CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.  Details regarding what is involved in bringing a complaint and the procedures for informal and formal resolution are available from the Office of Support and Safety Assessment for student-to-student behavior and the Office of Equal Opportunity for matters involving non-students such as faculty, staff, affiliates, or visitors and matters involving a student and non-student person. See more details at the catalog .    Academic Integrity and the Honor Code  We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself \"Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?\" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously, so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.  This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at the catalog and TILT .     All-University Core Curriculum (AUCC)  The Colorado Commission on Higher Education has approved Math 112 for inclusion in the Guaranteed Transfer (GT) Pathways program in the GT-MA1 category. For transferring students, successful completion with a minimum C- grade guarantees transfer and application of credit in this GT Pathways category. For more information on the GT Pathways program, go to the CDHE .  Content Criteria: Content Competencies pertain to the knowledge base, methods, concepts, and content-related learning that students should garner from participation in a course. Students should be able to demonstrate acquisition of such content focused learning as a result of participation in courses in each category of the AUCC.

  "body": " Units   Units give measurements meaning. If units are ignored or mis-used, this could lead us to make (at best) inaccurate or (at worst) harmful conclusions. The purpose of this activity will be to practice working with and communicating measurements that contain units.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     convert a measurement from one unit to another.  communicate the meaning of a measurement by relating it to human experience.    Let's get to work...  Partner up with someone and assign the roles of Partner 1 and Partner 2 . Have a discussion using the script below, following the rule that the partner answering the question must give a numerical answer without units .  Partner 1: \"How far do you live from campus?\"  Partner 2: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 2: \"What's a normal temperature in your hometown right now?\"  Partner 1: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 1: \"How much weight would you be comfortable lifting over your head?\"  Partner 2: (Provide a numerical answer without units)  Partner 2: \"What's the longest distance you've ever run?\"  Partner 1: (Provide a numerical answer without units)    How much have you learned about your partner from their responses to these questions? Now use the script again, but provide units with your numerical answers.  Units give measurements meaning, so it is important that we have tools to work with and understand them.   A unit conversion factor is a ratio of numbers with units in which the numerator and denominator express the same quantity.   Take a moment to verbalize with your group why each of the following are examples of unit conversion factors, and any other observations or questions you have:   Unit conversion factors are used to convert a measurement in some unit to the same measurement in a different unit. For example, if I measured my height in inches to be inches but I wanted to know my height measured in the units of feet, I could compute Let's take a moment to notice a few important things about this calculation:  My goal was to convert from inches to feet. Therefore, I needed to use a conversion factor relating these two units:   When doing a computation with numbers and units, I can treat the number parts and unit parts separately. Gather all the numbers together with multiplication and division, and gather all the units together with multiplcation and division. Units can cancel just like numbers!  When converting from inches to feet, I have a choice between using or . Knowing that units can cancel each other out helps me pick the correct form of the converstion factor, . In general, you will always want to set up the conversion factor so that the unit you are converting from is in the denominator , and the unit you are converting to is in the numerator .  Why does multiplying by not change the value of my original measurement? Remember that , so multiplying a number by is the same as multiplying by , which does not change its value.      Unit Conversion Factors Part 1   Now let's practice choosing correct unit conversion factors. Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button.      Before moving on, get at least three correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to choose a correct unit conversion factor as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Unit Conversion Factors Part 2   Now let's practice a full computation. Replace number with a correct number and unit with a correct unit abbreviation. Enter your numbers without using commas. Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button.      Before moving on, get at least three correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to perform a unit conversion as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Back to work...  At times we encounter measurements that are so extreme that it can be difficult to process them in a meaningful way. In these cases, it is useful to be able to frame the measurements in a way that is more relatable to our human experience. In what follows, you will get practice using unit conversions to communicate extreme measurements in a meaningful way.  As an example, let's say you're told that that the weight of the garbage deposited in your state's landfills in a calendar year was million tons ( this was true of Colorado in 2016! ). How much trash is this, really? We could pick something for comparison that we believe is common to most people's experience, like a school bus. We can then attempt to convert the measurement of million tons to the more relatable unit of school buses . So we'd like to convert from units of tons to units of school buses .  While weights of school buses vary, taking an approximate weight of an average school bus will be sufficient towards making this weight more meaningful. We will use the average school bus weight as pounds. This gives us a unit conversion factor of . This doesn't give us a single unit conversion factor relating tons and school buses , but we can convert tons to pounds ( ), and then pounds to school buses . As a computation, it looks like this: , or equivalently school buses! That's a lot of trash!    Relatable Measurements   While there is never one correct way to make extreme measurements more meaningful, it is always helpful to frame them in a way that you think will be more relatable to someone's common experience! Let's practice that now.      Individually, convert the following measurements to more meaningful units:     billion pounds      trillion      $ billion      million miles       Spend time in your group sharing your work. Discuss your process for performing the unit conversions, and which conversions you think are the most relatable.      Curious about these measurements?     billion pounds is the annual food waste in the U.S.   trillion is the volume of Lake Superior.  $ billion is the net worth of one of the world's wealthiest individuals.   million miles is the distance from the Earth to the sun.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  Why are units in measurements important?  Your friend wants to convert their weight from pounds to a unit called stone . What information would you tell them they need in order to do so? How would you tell them to use that information to accurately convert their weight from pounds to stone?  What are properties of a measurement that make it meaningful to you?

  "title": "Change and Estimation",
  "body": " Change and Estimation   Measurements used in discussions of complex questions are often not exact, but estimates of some exact meansurement. The purpose of this activity will be to describe some common ways that measurements can be estimated so that you understand these estimates when they are presented to you, and can create your own estimates to communicate to others.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     approximate relative change using pure numbers and percentages.  write very large or very small numbers in a user-friendly way.  make order-of-magnitude estimates.    Let's get to work...  In questions of sustainability, we are often dealing with measurements that change over time. Therefore, it is important that we are able to describe this change. There are two main ways we could do this:  We could describe the absolute change . For example, if a population is currently individuals, and a year later grows to to individuals, we could say that the absolute change from one year to the next is individuals.  We could describe the relative change . In the same example, we could say that the population grew by , since is of the initial population of .    In this activity, we will focus on describing the relative change of measurements, since this generally is most informative. Following our example above, if you told someone that the population grew by individuals, it is not clear how significant this growth is. Is a lot? a little? That significance is clarified when we describe the relative growth as a percent of the initial population. The growth of individuals is very small compared to the initial population of .  We can describe relative change using percentages or pure number multiples. The following examples illustrate both of these methods:  A bank account increased from to . It grew by times, or by .  The mass of nitrogen in a soil sample decreased from g to g. It decreased by times, or by .    Let's make two general observations about these examples that we can use moving forward:  Describing change using pure number multiples requires setting up the ratio . The resulting number is unitless, and gives us the constant multiple of the old measurement that would result in the new measurement. A pure number multiple greater than signifies the measurement increased, while a pure number multiple between and signifies the measurement decreased.  Describing change using percentages can be obtained from a pure number multiple as for increasing measurments, or for decreasing measurements.      Relative Change   Now let's practice describing the relative change of measurments. Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button.      Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to compute the relative change of a measurement as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Back to work...  Suppose you were told that the annual emmissions from a given country was tons. Would your interpretation of that measurement be significantly different if you instead were told that the amount was tons? These two measurement have the same order-of-magnitude , which can be a useful concept to understand for interpreting and creating estimates of very large or very small measurements. Watch this brief video as a group for an introduction to orders of magnitude.     Scientific Notation   First, let's practice using scientific notation to express very large or very small numbers in a user-friendly way.      Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to write very large or very small numbers using scientific notation as if you were explaining it to someone new.     The power of used when writing numbers in scientific notation is called the order-of-magnitude of that number. This is often the most usable part of a measurment for practical purposes, and is also the best starting place for making estimates of measurements that have limited information. We call an estimate of the form an order-of-magnitude estimate .   Orders of Magnitude   As a group, make order of magnitude estimates for the following measurements. Identify the order of magnitude for each of your measurements.       The number of students enrolled at CSU Fort Collins.      The mass of an average human in kilograms. (Note )      The distance from Fort Collins to Denver in meters. (Note )      The number of people on a commercial flight in the U.S. right now. (Note the U.S. population )      Curious about the actual values?    For 2024-25, the student count was . The order of magnitude is .  The average mass is roughly kg. The order of magnitude is .  The distance is roughly m ( miles). The order of magnitude is .  There's no clear answer for this one. How might you go about using your experience to make the best order of magnitude estimate that you can?      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are the different methods that you can use to describe how a measurement has changed over time? How are these methods similar? How are they different?  Why is it useful to use scientific notation to write very large or very small numbers?  What is the order-of-magnitude of a number? Why is it useful to think about the order of magnitude of a measurement?      Section Checkpoint  Sign in to your Doenet course to complete the checkpoint questions.   "

  "title": "Representations",
  "body": " Representations   Measurments are only useful if they help us to further our understanding, and can be communicated to others in an impactful way. One of the most effective ways to understand and communicate measurements is through visual representation. The purpose of this activity is to practice reading and representating measuremennts in an organized, visual way.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     use tables to communicate quantitative information.  use graphical representations (line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts) to communicate quantitative information.    Let's get to work...  Below are several representations of measurements: as tables , line graphs , bar charts , scatter plots , and pie charts .    Introduction to Representations   Take about minutes to individually review the representations. Sources for the representations are from the EIA Power and Natural Gas data.   For each representation, answer the following questions.   What type of representation was used?    What measurement(s) are involved in the representation?    What pattern(s) are conveyed by the representation about those measurements?          A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1930 to 2023. Information is displayed as discrete points, where the point's position in the horizontal direction determines the year and the point's position in the vertical direction determines the natural gas production in that year. Production trends upward until about 1970, remains somewhat steady until about 2005, and then trends upward again.          A pie chart showing the percentage of total carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 from power plants categorized by region of the United States. Each region is represented by a section of the pie, and the size of that section is representative of the percentage total carbon dioxide emissions that region was responsible for in 2023.        A table displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1930 to 2023. This is the same data used to produce the scatter plot, just in numerical form. Access the original source provided at the beginning of the section to read individual cell entries.          A bar chart showing the amount of total carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 from power plants categorized by region of the United States. This is the same data used to produce the pie chart. Each region is represented by a bar, and the height of that bar is representative of the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that region was responsible for in 2023.        A line graph displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1930 to 2023. This is the same data used to produce the scatter plot, but graphed as a continuous line instead of discrete points.        Representations Summary   As a group, use your individual observations to brainstorm a list of qualities that describe each type of representation.     Representation  Good For...    Table     Line Graph     Bar Chart     Scatter Plot     Pie Chart        When creating your own representations, it is not only important to pick a representation that fits the type of data that you have, but also think about how you will design that representation. Looking at the examples above,     what was done well to communicate data patterns clearly?      what could be improved to communicate the data more clearly?        Back to work...  We will not spend time in this activity learning the various technologies that can be used to create visual representations, but instead we will focus on making an appropriate choice of representation based on the data we are representing, and the pattern(s) we would like to convey.    Choosing a Representation   For each scenario below, discuss in your group which representation you think would be most appropriate, and why.      You have measurements of the amount of energy used per household in your city over a given month. You'd like to present the measurements in a way that emphasizes the neighborhoods in your city which used the most energy in that month.      You have measurements of SO2 emissions in your county for the last decade, measured every quarter of a year. You'd like to emphasize that the SO2 emissions are consistently greater in one particular quarter of the year.      You have measurements of the mass of an iceberg for the last years. You'd like to emphasize how this mass has changed over that time period, particularly in the last years.       Back to work...  While visual representations can be extremely useful for communicating patterns in large amounts of data, they are also vulnerable to being used in ways that can be misleading. It's important to be careful to avoid misleading visuals when creating your own representations, and to view visual representations that are presented to you with a critical eye.    Misleading Representations   In your group, discuss the cases provided below.      A three-dimensional pie chart showing the percentage of total carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 from power plants categorized by region of the United States. Comparative sizes of pieces of the pie are more ambiguous than in the two-dimensional version.      The pie chart above is the same pie chart presented in . Compare and contrast the two representations. Can you identify anything that may be misleading?         A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1930 to 2023. Production trends upward until about 1970, remains somewhat steady until about 2005, and then trends upward again.      A line graph displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1930 to 2023. This is the same data used to produce the scatter plot, but graphed as a continuous line.       The scatter plot and the line graph from represent the same data, and are shown above. Compare and contrast the two representations. Can you identify anything that may be misleading?        A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1986 to 2000. The vertical axis does not start at zero, which makes the upward trend look drastic.      The scatter plot above uses the same data as the scatter plot in , but just of the years 1986-2000. Compare and contrast the two representations. Can you identify anything that may be misleading?      A Comparison  Below is a comparison of the scatter plot presented in the previous exercise with the same section on a standard scale:     A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1986 to 2000. The vertical axis does not start at zero, which makes the upward trend look drastic.      A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each year from 1986 to 2000. The vertical axis starts at zero, which gives a more realistic visual of the upward trend.      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  When choosing a visual representation for your data, what are the main factors that you consider?  In what ways can visual representations be misleading, and how can you analyze them to avoid being misled?     Section Checkpoint  There are no checkpoint questions for this section.   "

  "title": "Stocks and Flows",
  "body": " Stocks and Flows   Questions of sustainability arise when we work with systems that are flowing; that is, systems whose measurements are changing. The purpose of this activity is to introduce stock-flow models and system diagrams for representing such systems.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...   Section Objectives   represent a stock-flow model with a system diagram.    Let's get to work...  Imagine a bathtub filled with water. The faucet is running and the drain is open. You may look at this system and notice that either  the water level in the tub is staying the same,  the water level is increasing, or  the water level is decreasing.    Regardless of what you observe, this is a system in movement! While this is a simple system, it contains the important components we often need to consider in sustainability questions:  The amount of water is a quantity of the system that we care to measure.  The faucet and the drain are components that contribute to change in the amount of water.    These components are generally referred to as stocks and flows , respectively.   A stock is a quantity in a system that can be added to or taken from over time.  A flow is a process in a system that can add to or take away from a stock.   The identification of stocks and flows in a system is called a stock-flow model of that system.    Stock-Flow Models   In your group, brainstorm two different systems that you are interested in, and create stock-flow models of those systems.     Back to work...  Once we have a stock-flow model of a system, it is useful to be able to represent that model with a visual. The standard representation for these is called a system diagram .  Let's consider our bathtub example from the beginning of this section. A basic system diagram for this system might look as follows:    A system diagram for the bathtub example showing stocks as squares, flows as arrows, and flow rate processes as triangles.   Let's make some observations about this system diagram:  The stock (volume of water) is represented with a square. While there is only one stock in this system diagram, it is possible to have multiple stocks in a system diagram.  The flows are represented with arrows, indicating whether they are making the stock increase ( inflow ) or decrease ( outflow ). Each flow arrow into or out of the stock is associated with a triangle, which represents a mechanism or process which controls the rate of the corresponding flow.  The circles represent stocks outside of the system we are considering. If these stocks contribute inflows into our system they are called sources . If these stocks receive outflows from our system, they are called sinks .  So far our system diagram is a visual organization of the stocks and flows we've identified in our system. These stocks and flows can also be associated with measurements (that have units ), which we'll need in order to make computations and predictions about our system. This will become our focus in the next sections.      System Diagrams   Work in your group to create stock-flow models and system diagrams for each system below. Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to recall the various components that comprise a system diagram.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are stocks and flows, and how are they related?  What things do you consider when creating a stock-flow model for a system?  Is there a single best stock-flow model for a system?

  "body": " Net Flow and Equilibrium   Many natural systems have stocks that don't change, even though these systems are flowing constantly. The purpose of this activity is to be able to recognize when stocks are in such a state.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     calculate the net flow of a stock and recognize when a stock is in equilibrium.  calculate the residence time associated with a stock in equilibrium.    Let's get to work...  Let's return to our system diagram for a bathtub system from .  Recall that the arrows represent flows of the system, and the triangles represent processes that control the rate of each flow. The system diagram helps us to understand the important components of a system and how they are related, but to understand the behavior of the system we must also know the measurements involved: the numerical values of the stocks and the rates, along with their units. Let's consider three examples.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the outflow rate is greater than the inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will decrease.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the inflow rate is greater than the outflow rate, so over time the volume of water will increase.  The water volume is gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is , and the outflow rate to the drain is . In this scenario, the inflow rate is equal to the inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will remain at gallons.    Let's make a few important observations about these examples.  In all of the examples we are comparing the inflow rates to the outflow rates to determine the qualitative behavior of the volume of water over time. To be more precise, we could calculate the net flow rate : If there were multiple flows in the same direction, we would add them to get the total flow in that direction. A positive net flow for a stock means that stock is increasing over time, while a negative net flow for a stock means that stock is decreasing over time. Calculate the net flows for each example above, then check your answers below. Include units in your answer. Check Answers Here         In the last example, the net flow is . If a stock's net flow is , we say that stock is in equilibrium . In this case, the equilibrium value of the stock is gallons.  Our focus in this chapter will be mostly on systems in equilibrium. In general this will be more complex than what we've just considered. For example, flow rates may not be constant. We will re-visit systems not in equilibrium and how they change over time in chapter 4.      Net Flow   Let's practice computing the net flow of a stock.     The following system diagram is for the stock of atmospheric carbon, measured in gigatons (GT). The flows are measured in GT per year. We are accounting for inflows from plants (plant respiration), sea (air\/sea gas exchange), soil (microbial respiration and decomposition), and humans (human emissions), and for outflows to plants (photosynthesis) and sea (air\/sea gas exchange).  Choose new variations of the model by selecting the New Variation button. Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to compute net flow and what that means for the behavior of a stock as if you were explaining it to someone new.       Back to work...  A stock in equilibrium is not changing in quantity. But as we've discussed, it is moving . If the inflows and outflows for a stock are both non-zero, even when a stock may appear to be static, the constant quantity is never comprised of the same stuff . There is a measure for the average time a unit of stock will spend between inflow and outflow, which is what we will explore next.   The residence time associated with a stock in equilibrium is the number .     Residence Time   In your group, answer the following questions to better understand residence time.      Does this calculation make sense for stocks not in equilibrium? Why or why not?      What type of units do you think this number will have? Why? Give at least one example.      Consider a stock-flow model whose stock is number of undergraduate students at a University, with a single inflow of admitted students and a single outflow of graduating students. Assuming this stock is in equilibrium, calculate the residence time of the stock for each scenario below. Discuss its meaning in the context of the model.

What is the net flow rate of a stock, and why is it important in determining the behavior of a stock over time?  What does the residence time of a stock in equilibrium tell us about that stock?

  "body": " Equilibrium Values   In real-world systems there are typically factors that influence the rates of flows within stock-flow models. The purpose of this activity is to consider a common influence, and its impact on the value of a stock in equilibrium.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     recognize dependencies between stock values and flow rates, and represent them on a system diagram.  compute equilibrium values in stock-flow models with a single stock.    Let's get to work...  Let's return once again to our system diagram for a bathtub system from , with one small addition:    A system diagram for the bathtub example showing stocks as squares, flows as arrows, flow rate processes as triangles, and the dependency between water volume and the drain rate as a red link.   In this new diagram we've added a red dependency link between the water stock and the outflow controlled by the drain. We've added this to indicate that the outflow is not, in fact, constant as we've assumed in previous examples, but it varies depending on the water depth value: a larger water depth value will result in a larger outflow rate through the drain.    Dependency Links   Let's practice identifying and representing dependencies between flow rates and stocks. For each stock-flow model below, create a system diagram with dependency links. Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to recall the various components that comprise a system diagram.  Write a short description of what you think the dependency is and how it will affect the flow rate.      Back to work...  As with our previous system diagrams, so far we've just identified and represented something in the system that will impact its behavior. To make dependency links useful in computation, we need to to know more specifically what that dependency is as an equation.  We now ask the same question as in : is this stock in equilibrium? With flow rates that change, the answer is not as straightforward as when they were constant. We will return to our example of the bathtub system from the beginning of the section.  For the sake of our example, let's assume that the inflow rate from the faucet is constant at gallons per minute, while the outflow rate (in gallons per minute) is dependent on the water depth (in inches) by the equation .  What are the units of the constant ?    We know that the stock will be in equilibrium when its inflow rate and outflow rate are equal. As an equation, that means that , or . We can solve for by dividing both sides of the equation by to get inches. This now gives us information to understand how our system will behave.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is less than inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will be greater than the outflow rate (why?). Therefore the net flow rate will be positive, and the water volume will increase until it reaches a depth of inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is greater than inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will be less than the outflow rate (why?). Therefore the net flow rate will be negative, and the water volume will decrease until it reaches a depth of inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.  If our initial water volume is such that the depth is equal to inches, then initially the inflow rate of gallons per minute will equal the outflow rate . Therefore the net flow will be zero, and the water volume will remain constant.      Equilibrium Values   Let's continue to practice finding equilibrium values for stocks that have dependent links to flow rates. For each stock-flow model below,  Sketch a system diagram on paper with the indicated dependency links.  Compute the equilibrium value of the stock.  Use the computed equilibrium value to describe the behavior of the system.        Stock: Number of undergraduate students at a University  Flows: Admitted students, graduating students  Rates:   Graduation rate is constant at students per year  Admission rate ( ) depends on the number of undergrads ( ):          Stock: Population of a community  Flows: Births, deaths  Rates:   Death rate is constant at individuals per year  Birth rate ( ) depends on the population ( ):        Stock: Population of a community  Flows: Births, deaths  Rates:   Death rate ( ) depends on the population ( ):  Birth rate ( ) depends on the population ( ):        Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are dependency links and why are they important in stock-flow models?  Why is it more challenging to compute the equilibrium value of a stock if the flow rates are not constant?  Do you think that stock values will always change towards an equilibrium value?     Section Checkpoint  Sign in to your Doenet course to complete the checkpoint questions.   "

  "body": " Parameters   In real-world systems there may be factors which are not stocks within the system, but still influence the rates of flows within stock-flow models. The purpose of this activity is to consider these factors.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     recognize parameters in stock-flow models, and represent them on a system diagram.  analyze how parameter values affect equilibrium in stock-flow models.    Let's get to work...    Dependency Links: Re-visited   As a group, review the system diagram below. Describe a stock-flow model you think this could represent.  What is the stock? Include reasonable units.  What are the flows? Include reasonable units.  Are there factors not currently represented in this diagram that you think would have a significant impact on the value of the stock?       A system diagram with a single stock, single outflow, and single dependency link.     Back to work...  One description of the system above could be a cup of coffee sitting on a table. Considered as a stock-flow model, we could say that the stock is the temperature of the coffee Technically you might say that our stock measures the amount of heat energy in the coffee, but since we can relate temperature directly to the heat energy, it is OK (and maybe more intuitive) to use temperature as a measurement in its place. (in degrees Celsius), and the only flow is the outflow of heat (measured in degrees Celsius per minute).  In this example, the outflow rate will be dependent not only on the value of the stock, but also on  the outside temperature that the cup of coffee is exposed to. It will cool faster if it's sitting outside in cold weather than if it's sitting inside on a counter at room temperature.  the insulation properties of the cup holding the coffee. It will stay warmer longer if it's in a glass container than it would if it's in a metal container.    From the perspective of the stock-flow model, these two factors do not fit into any component we've discussed so far. They are not stocks (quantities that are being added to or taken from) and they are not flows. We define these new components that we may want to account for in stock-flow models now.   A parameter in a stock-flow model is a quantity that affects one or more flow rate in the model, and is constant for a fixed model.   In the coffee cup example, the outside temperature and the insulation properties of the cup are both parameters. These values don't change for a fixed model (if the coffee cup is outside in a ceramic mug, these values are constants), but their values nevertheless will impact how the temperature behaves. In a system diagram, we will represent parameters with rectangles, and indicate the flow rate they impact with a dependency link. Here is an example of an updated system diagram for the coffee cup example.    A system diagram for the coffee cup example, including the insulation properties of the cup as well as the outside temperature as parameters which both affect the heat loss rate.     Parameters in System Diagrams   Let's practice recognizing potential parameters in stock-flow models and representing them in a system diagram. For each stock-flow model below, identify any parameters you think might be present. Then create a system diagram including those parameters.  Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to recall the various components that comprise a system diagram.      Back to work...  Working with parameters is important because it allows us to analyze multiple different models at once. For example, suppose we are interested in installing solar panels as an energy source for our home. We will use the stock-flow model represented by the system diagram below.    A system diagram for the amount of energy stored in solar panels, with an inflow from the sun, outflow from energy use, and a parameter of the panels' area which impacts the inflow rate from the sun.   The coverage area of the solar panels is a parameter because it is a constant once we install them, but it impacts the inflow rate of energy that we receive from the sun. We would like to determine the value of this parameter that results in an equilibrium value of for our stock.  Suppose that the outflow rate of energy from the panels is constant at watts. The inflow rate ( ) from the sun is dependent on both the amount of energy in the panels ( ), measured in watt-hours (Wh), and the area of the panels ( ), measured in square meters, according to the equation .  We also know that the stock is in equilibrium when the inflow rate is equal to the outflow rate, or as an equation, when .  Unlike in the last section, our equation has two unknown quantities, and . But we also know that we'd like the equilibrium value to be . Substituting this value into our equation gives , which can be solved to find that square meters. Using the parameter in our analysis helps us make an educated decision about the solar panels in order to achieve a certain behavior from the system.    Parameters and Equilibrium Values   Let's practice using parameters in equilibrium calculations. For each stock-flow model below,  Sketch a system diagram on paper with the indicated parameters and dependency links.  Determine the parameter value that will result in the desired equilibrium value.        Stock: Population of a community  Flows: Births, deaths  Parameters: Carrying capacity  Rates:   Death rate is constant at individuals per year  Birth rate ( ) depends on the population ( ) and the carrying capacity ( ):    Desired Equilibrium:         Stock: Temperature in a greenhouse  Flows: Sun, heat loss  Parameters: Outside temperature, thickness of greenhouse material  Rates:   Temperature rate is constant from the sun at fahrenheit per day  Heat loss ( ) depends on the inside temperature ( ), the outside temperature ( ), and the thickness in milimeters of the greenhouse material ( ):    Desired Equilibrium:  fahrenheit, given that the outside temperature is fahrenheit      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  How are parameters different from stocks and flows?  Why might parameters be important to include in a stock-flow model?

  "title": "Networks and Graphs",
  "body": " Networks and Graphs   We live in a very connected world. From social interactions to predator-prey relationships, connections have a large impact on how systems behave. The purpose of this activity is to introduce an important mathematical tool used to model network connections.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     represent a network using a graph or directed graph.  determine basic properties of a graph.    Let's get to work...  A network is a set of entitities which have a rule that defines when two entities in the set are related. This is a very broad concept which arises in various contexts. For example, a network may consist of a set of twenty neighborhoods (call them A through T), with the rule that two neighborhoods are related if there is a road that connects them.    Networks   In your group, brainstorm examples of three different networks that you are familiar with.     Mathematically, we can represent networks with graphs . Though you may have heard this term in a math class previously, it is likely different than what you are picturing. Below is an example of a graph of the neighborhood network we described above.    A graph whose vertices, labeled A through T, represent neiborhoods, and whose edges represent roads connecting neighborhoods. Edges Listed as Pairs  A graph can also be represented by giving a set of coordinate pairs. Two vertices are listed as a pair if there is an edge between them. The graph above would be represented as coordinate pairs as follows:          Let's make some important observations about graphs using this example:  An entity (in this example, a neighborhood) is represented by a point called a vertex . Two entities are related (in this example, there is a road connecting two neighborhoods) if they are connected by a line called an edge . If two vertices are connected by an edge, we call them neighbors .  It is important to note that this graph communicates nothing about the actual physical location of each neighborhood. You can move the vertices anywhere you wish (try it!), and it would still be the same graph. The graph communicates only which entities are in the network, and how they are related to each other.    The number of edges coming from one vertex is called the degree of that vertex. For example, the degree of vertex A is , and the degree of vertex S is .  A path between two verices is a sequence of edges that connects one vertex to the other. A graph is connected if there is a path between any two verices. Otherwise, it is disconnected . For example, the graph of above is disconnected because there is no path from vertex M to vertex A. However, the graph obtained by ommitting vertices K through O is connected, as is the graph consisting of only vertices K through O.  A graph can be useful for making qualitative observations about a network. For example, while there is no path from vertices K through O to other vertices, they are highly connected to each other. Also, vertices A, J, and T seem to be structurally important neighborhoods. There are many roads connecting them to other neighborhoods (they have a high degree), and if we got rid of them, many more neighborhoods would become disconnected. We'll make these ideas more precise in the next section.      Graphs   Let's practice creating graphs to represent networks. Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to recall the various components that comprise a graph. After you have created a graph, answer the following questions.  Which vertex in your graph has the highest degree?  Is your graph connected?  What do your previous answers mean in the context of your network?     A map of Central America and the Carribean    A geographical map of countries in Central America and the Carribean. The countries that share a border are listed as the following pairs:  (Mexico, Guatemala), (Mexico, Belize), (Guatemala, Belize), (Guatemala, Honduras), (Guatemala, El Salvador), (El Salvador, Honduras), (Haiti Dominican, Republic)       Back to work...  There are variations of graphs that can be obtained by adding additional structure based on the needs of your model. We present one such variation here due to its connection with our topic from .   A directed graph is a graph whose edges have a specified direction. That is, there are two different edges that could connect vertices A and B: the edge AB ( A to B ) and the edge BA ( B to A ).   The visual difference in directed graphs is that the edges are represented by arrows, which provide the additional information of direction. For example, directed graphs can be used to represent predator-prey relationships within an ecosystem. Take a moment to interpret the directed graph below in your group.

  "title": "Resilience",
  "body": " Resilience   It is important to acknowledge that our systems are susceptible to changes that we may not be able to predict. Operating systems fail, natural disasters occur, and relationships end. Therefore, an important consideration in questions of sustainability is that of resilience: to what extent is a system able to continue functioning after sudden or unexpected damage? The purpose of this activity is to introduce two properties that we can compute to quantify the resilience of a network modeled as a graph.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     compute the density of a graph.  compute the clustering coefficient of a vertex.  compute the vertex and edge connectivity of a graph.    Let's get to work...   Resilience can reference various things in science and daily life. In this section, we use the term resilience as a measure of how connected a network is: to what extent can a network continue to function as intended in the midst of network connection failures? A specific class of graphs, which we define now, will be important in our discussion.   A complete graph is a graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.   From the perspective of connectivity, complete graphs are as connected as a graph can be. Below are examples of complete graphs on , , and vertices, respectively.    Complete graphs with , , and vertices. There is an edge between every vertex.     Complete Graphs   As a group, answer the following questions:     Back to work...  An intuitive way to describe how connected a network is would be to measure how closely the graph that represents it resembles a complete graph. One such measurement is called the density of the graph.   The density of a graph is the ratio .   The density of a graph will be a number between and , which can be thought of as the percentage of possible edges that the graph contains. Since we previously found a formula for the number of edges the complete graph with vertices contains, the density of a graph with vertices can be re-written as .    Graph Densities   As a group, answer the following questions about graph densities:     Back to work...  While a graph's density does give us some useful measure of how connected a graph is, we must be careful to understand what this number does (and does not) tell us, and that we can rarely draw conclusions from this number alone.  For example, suppose graph from above represents a signal network. The vertices are routers, and there is an edge between two vertices if those two routers can share a signal. From our density computation of , it might be tempting to say that this network is very connected . But from the perspective of resilience, how accurate is this statement? Most routers in the system could go down without impacting the ability of the other routers to communicate with one another. However, there is one router (can you identify which one?) whose failure would result in other routers being disconnected from one another. This is not ideal for resilient networks.  The important thing to note here is that a graph's density is a global measurement. That is, it is a number that says something about the graph's edges as a whole, but does not say anything about how they are distributed throughout the graph (which ultimately will determine the resilience of a network in situations such as the previous paragraph). In order to describe how edges are distributed throughout a graph, we need a local measurement. That is, a number that describes a graph's edges near a specific vertex.   The clustering coefficient of a vertex is the ratio . If the degree of is one or zero, is defined to be .   The clustering coefficient of a vertex will be a number between and , which can be thought of as the percentage of possible edges that the neighbors of contains. Assuming the vertex has degree , and using the formula for the number of edges the complete g raph with vertices contains, the clustering coefficient of can be re-written as .    Clustering Coefficients   As a group, answer the following questions about clustering coefficients:     Back to work...  The concept of a router failing and disconnecting other routers in the signal network example has a formal definition in the context of graphs.   The vertex connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of vertices whose removal (along with their associated edges) would disconnect the graph.   The vertex connectivity of graph from our previous examples is , because there is a single vertex that can be removed which disconnects the graph. There is also an analagous definition for the removal of edges.   The edge connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose removal would disconnect the graph.     Connectivity   As a group, answer the following questions regarding connectivity.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  Describe the different ways that we can measure the extent to which a graph is connected.  In what sense does measuring the connectivity of a graph tell us about the resilience of a network?

  "title": "Dynamic Models and Feedback",
  "body": " Dynamic Models and Feedback   Real-world stocks are dynamic. They are constantly moving based on many factors within the system that contains it. Sometimes that movement is less obvious than others, like when a stock is in equilibrium (i.e., the stock value is constant). However, important sustainability questions arise when stock values change over time. The purpose of this activity is to practice analyzing stock-flow models to determine common qualitative behaviors of stock values that are changing.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     identify and label feedback loops in system diagrams.  describe the general qualitative behavior of systems that can result from feedback loops.    Let's get to work...  We saw in that flow rates in and out of a stock will often vary depending on the stock's value. This is a critical factor which causes stock values to change over time, so we give it a special name.   In a stock-flow model, a feedback loop is a process in which a stock's value changes the behavior of a flow rate into or out of that stock.   Using terminology from , a feedback loop will exist whenever there is a dependency link between a stock and flow rate into or out of that stock. In this chapter, we will think more carefully about what that dependency link is, and how it impacts the behavior of the stock. Let's start with an example.  Suppose that our stock is the amount of phosphorus in a lake, and that our model has two flows:  An outflow of of phosphorus as water leaves the lake to a stream. This flow rate is proportional to the amount of phosphorus in the lake water (i.e., the more phosphorus in the water, the larger the outflow rate of phosphorus).  An inflow of phosphorus as plants and algae decompose. Since phosphorus is a nutrient for plants and algae, this flow rate also increases as the amount of phosphorus in the lake water increases.    How the amount of phosporus changes is dependent on how flow rates are impacted by the stock's value, which we described verbally. We can also represent this behavior in a system diagram:    A system diagram for the amount of phosphorus in a lake including feedback loops involving the inflow of phosphorus from plants and algae, and the outflow of phosphorus due to lake drainage.   Let's make some important observations about this new diagram.  We've added plus signs to the dependency links to indicate that an increase in the amount of phosphorus would increase both the inflow and outflow rates. In general, if an increase in the stock causes a flow rate to increase, we add a to that dependency link. If an increase in the stock causes a flow rate to decrease, we add a to that dependency link.   These dependency links form two different feedback loops which are different in nature.   The feedback loop between the plants\/algae rate and the phosphorus stock is called amplifying , because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the inflow rate to increase, which further increases the amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is amplifying if an increase in the stock value causes the flow rate to change in a way that further reinforces the increase of the stock's value.  The feedback loop between the lake drain rate and the phosphorus stock is called stabilizing , because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the outflow rate to increase, which decreases the amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is stabilizing if an increase in the stock value causes the flow rate to change in a way that counteracts the stock's value from further increasing.        Feedback Loops   Let's practice distinguishing between amplifying and stabilizing feedback loops. Below is a diagram containing the four general possibilities for feedback loops. Move the labels to label each as amplifying or stabilizing . Record your final answers on the diagram in your portfolio.      Feedback Loops in System Diagrams   Let's practice identifying feedback loops in a few more models. For each stock-flow model below, work in your group to  Label each dependency link with a or , depending on how you think the stock impacts the flow rate.  Label each feedback loop as amplifying or stabilizing .    Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to visualize what you are labeling.     Back to work...  In we saw the usefulness of communicating measurements with visual representations. When analyzing stock-flow models, it is often helpful to use graphs which display a stock's value over time. The type of graph that is used will depend on the nature of the dynamic model that we are using. There are two main types of models.   A continuous dynamical system is a system in which stock measurements are made continuously over a time interval. A discrete dynamical system is a system in which stock measurements are made at equally spaced time intervals (eg., a measurement is taken once every year).   The visual representation of a stock value over time in a continuous dynamical system is a line graph, while the visual representation of a stock value over time in a discrete dynamical system is a scatter plot. This distinction is illustrated for a system which measures a population over time in     On the left, the line graph of a population modeled as a continuous dynamical system. On the right, a scatter plot of a population modeled as a discrete dynamical system.   Unless stated otherwise, we will focus our analyses around continuous dynamical systems when sketching graphs of stock values over time. In this section, we will begin to develop a strategy for translating system diagrams for continuous systems to line graphs that describe the qualitative behavior of a stock over time (like whether the stock is increasing or decreasing). In the next sections, we will develop line graphs in more detail for some common types of models.  As a first example, let's consider a general system diagram of the following form:    A system diagram which contains one inflow and one outflow, both of which are part of amplifying feedback loops.   The diagram indicates that an increase in stock increases the inflow, and an increase in stock decreases the outflow. Both of these feedback loops are amplifying. How does a stock in such a system behave over time? There is not a single answer to this question, but we can begin to answer it by remembering what ultimately determines whether a stock value increases or decreases:   The amplifying feedback loops tell us how the flow rates change as the stock value changes. As stock increases, the inflow rate increases ( ), and the outflow rate decreases ( ). so we can combine this information to determine how the net flow rate changes as the stock value changes:   An increase in the first number in the difference and a decrease in the second number in the difference both cause the difference to increase. That is, as the stock value increases, the netflow increases. Here is an example of representing such a relationship with a line graph:    A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that as the stock value increases, so does the net flow rate.   Take careful note of the axis labels: Stock and Net Flow . This visual shows us that as stock values increase (as we move to the right on the horizontal axis), net flow values also increase (we move up on the vertical axis).  This graph will prove to be extremely valuable in determining the behavior of the stock with respect to time, and shows us that the behavior will be dependent on the stock's initial value. Let's consider a few cases.  If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be negative. This meanse the stock will decrease. Since the net flow remains negative for stock values to the left of , the stock will continue to decrease as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is one, the net flow will be negative, which means the stock will decrease from this initial stock value.    If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be positive. This meanse the stock will increase. Since the net flow remains positive for stock values to the r ight of , the stock will continue to increase as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is five, the net flow will be positive, which means the stock will increase from this initial stock value.    If the stock's initial value is , then the graph shows us that the net flow will be zero. This means the stock is in equilibrium, so it's value will not change. The stock will continue to have the equilibrium value as time moves on.   A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that if the stock value is three, the net flow will be zero, which means the stock will be in equilibrium.      Take a moment to use the interactive below to change the initial stock value on the horizontal axis, and see the resulting stock-time graph. Be sure to test the values mentioned in the cases above to verify the descriptions given.    On the left, a sample line graph showing the net flow rate increasing as stock value increases, with an equilibrium stock value of three. On the right, the corresponding line graph of the stock's value over time using the indicated initial value from the graph on the left. If the initial value is less than three, the stock value decreases rapidly with time. If the initial value is greater than three, the stock value increases rapidly with time. If the initial value equals three, the stock value remains constant over time.     Stock Behavior with Stabilizing Feedback   Let's practice translating a system diagram with stabilizing feedback loops to a line graph describing the stock's behavior over time. The general system diagram has the following form:      While we analyzed just two specific models here, the general strategy developed is a useful one:  Determine how the net flow rate changes as the stock value changes, and represent this relationship as a line graph.  Use the line graph to describe how a stock's value will change for various initial values of the stock.  Translate your descriptions to a line graph of the stock over time.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  In a stock-flow model, what is a feedback loop, and why is it important in determining a stock's behavior over time?  What is the difference between a continuous dynamical system and a discrete dynamical system?  What are the similarities and differences in a stock's behavior over time in models with amplifying feedback loops versus stabilizing feedback loops?

  "body": " The Exponential Model   There is a particular dependency link relationship that occurs frequently in real-world systems. The purpose of this activity is to understand the behavior of stocks whose flow rates have this type of dependency.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the characteristics of exponential behavior.  identify when feedback loops will result in exponential behavior of a stock over time, and sketch the general shape of that behavior.    Let's get to work...  A very common behavior exhibited of stocks in many systems (at least for a period of time) is exponential behavior . To understand this behavior, let's look at some examples of measurements over time that behave this way, and review calculating absolute change and relative change from .  Imagine that is a measurement of a population (in millions of individuals) after years.                                Absolute and Relative Change Part 1   Let's practice calculating both the absolute change: and the relative change: of this population on each time interval given below.      As a group, make some observation about this table:  How does the absolute change of these measurements behave from one time interval to the next?  How does the relative change of these measurements behave from one time interval to the next?        Let's look at one more example. Imagine that is a measurement of the amount nitrogen (in kilograms) left in a soil sample after years.                                Absolute and Relative Change Part 2   Use the table below to calculate both the absolute change and the relative change of this amount on each time interval given.      As a group, make some observation about this table:  How does the absolute change of these measurements behave from one time interval to the next?  How does the relative change of these measurements behave from one time interval to the next?  How are these behaviors different from and similar to the behaviors you observed for ?       Back to work...   An exponential relationship is a relationship whose relative change during any single unit of time is constant. If the constant relative change is greater than one, we call it exponential growth . If the the relative change is between zero and one, we call it exponential decay .   As we saw in the table calculuations above, exponential relationships can be good for describing models that either  Increase or decrease very rapidly, or  Increase or decrease very gradually.    A transformation of a line graph is a new line graph obtained from stretching, shifting, or reflecting the original line graph. Since transformations of exponential relationships still exhibit the general properties described above, we will also refer to transformations of exponentials relationships as exhibiting exponential behavior. It will be useful to be able to visualize the line graphs representing this behavior.    Exponential Graphs   Below we'll practice graphing the family of exponential relationships . Use the sliders for each parameter to change the graph to a new exponential relationship that goes through all three points given.      Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button. Before moving on, attempt at least different versions, and write down observations for how graphs of exponential relationships can behave as if you were explaining it to someone new.     Back to work...  Now we will look at how exponential relationships arise in stock-flow models. Suppose we have a stock with a single inflow of units per second. If we assume an initial stock value of units, then after the first second we would have an inflow of units, meaning our total stock after the first second would be units. If we continue to take measurements after each second Note that we are treating this as a discrete system, in which measurements are taken at equally spaced time intervals. This is opposed to a continuous system, in which measurements are taken continuously over a time interval. , we would have the measurements recorded in after the first four seconds.                              This table should remind us of that we analyzed earlier: the stock's value is increasing rapidly, but if we compute the relative change between each time interval we get the constant . The inflow to this stock increases in an exponential way! This behavior is the result of the constant multiplication of the stock's value by the factor . Any flow rate of the form , where is a non-zero constant, will result in exponential behavior of the stock's value. If the flow rate has the form , where is a non-zero constant, this will result in a transformation of exponential behavior. Because of this, we give flow rates of this form a special name.   If a stock has a flow rate of the form , where and are constants, we say that flow rate is linear .   As we've just seen, linear flow rates in which the constant is non-zero result in exponential behavior of a stock's value. We saw in the previous section that it is the net flow rate of a stock that determines a stock's behavior over time, so the following fact is relevant.   If a stock's inflow and outflow rates are linear, then its net flow rate is also linear.   Let's return to our example of the stock with inflow rate , and suppose also there is a single outflow of units per second. Then the net flow rate for the stock is  . It is important to note that the negative sign in front of does not mean that the net flow is always negative! It depends on :  If , the net flow will be positive.  If , the net flow will be negative.  If , the net flow will be . That is, the stock is in equilibrium.    This is where it is helpful to have a line graph of the net flow rate with respect to the stock's value. In our example this would produce a graph that looks familiar from :   A line graph showing that the net flow decreases as the stock value increases.      Stock Behavior Over Time   On a separate sheet of paper, sketch what you think the line graph would look like for the stock over time for each of the initial stock values of , , and . After your group has discussed your responses, you can use the interactive below to check your answers.     Back to work...  We have now discussed some general characteristics of feedback loops, and also the specific case of exponential behavior.    Stabilizing and Amplifying Exponential Behavior   Work in your group to put these ideas together by grouping together all graphs and equations that are stabilizing and amplifying. Separate your answers with a comma.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are the characteristics of a stock that changes exponentially over time?  How do you know when feedback loops will result in exponential behavior of a stock?  How do you know when exponential behavior will be stabilizing or amplifying? What's the difference between these two types of behavior visually on a graph of the stock's value over time?

  "title": "The Logistic Model",
  "body": " The Logistic Model   In the last section we discussed linear flow rates, and the specific cases which result in exponential behavior of a stock over time. It is possible for flow rates to be non-linear, which in general result in more complicated stock behavior. The purpose of this activity is to introduce a common non-linear flow rate, and tools for analyzing the behavior of these models.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the similarities and differences of the exponential and logistic models.  analyze the types of feedback present in a logistic model.  sketch a graph of a stock's value over time for a stock that follows a logistic model.    Let's get to work...  In the previous section we introduced exponential models, which arise when the net flow rate for a stock is linear (and not constant). There is a certain level of simplicity to these models because  There is always a single equilibrium value for the stock (when the linear net flow rate is equal to ), and  The overall feedback is always either amplifying or stabilizing (depending on whether the linear net flow rate increases or decreases as the the stock value increases).    These observations are illustrated in .    Two line graphs showing the relationship between net flow and stock value. The graph on the left is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of , and the overall feedback is always amplifying. The graph on the right is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of , and the overall feedback is always stabilizing.   If we consider flow rates that are not linear, these observations are no longer true. In general, there could be multiple equilibrium values of the stock, and the overall feedback affect may depend on the stock's value. While this makes the model more complicated, these complexities may be desired in order to obtain a more accurate model.  Let's consider modeling a population that is increasing over time. A good first model would be to use an amplifying exponential model, such as . This does a nice job at capturing the tendency for reproduction (Net Flow) to increase with an increase in Population (P). Depending on the purpose of your model, however, there may be one large flaw. With a positive initial value, this is an amplifying exponential model which is increasing, and the line graph for the population over time would look something like .    The line graph of a population over time which grows exponentially.   While the pattern of increase may be accurate at first, this graph shows that the population will continue to increase more and more rapidly without end. It does not account for factors such as limited resources, which at some point should start to have a stabilizing affect on the population. The logistic model takes this into account.   A stock-flow model follows a logistic model if the net flow rate of the stock has the form . The constant represents the growth rate of the stock when the stock value is very small. The constant represents the carrying capacity (the maximum population that the environment can sustain).   Note that while the logistic model has an amplifying factor ( ), it also has a stabilizing factor . That is, as increases, also increases, but decreases. We'll analyze the overall affect of these competing factors now.  Suppose we have a stock-flow model of a population with a single inflow of , and no outflow. That is, the population's net flow rate is . The growth rate when the population is very small is , and the carrying capacity of this population is individuals. The net flow rate is non-linear, and the graph of the net flow rate with respect to the population (stock) value is given in .    The graph of the net flow rate of a population with respect to the population size. The net flow rate increases for population values less than fifty, and decreases for population values greater than fifty.     Logistic Behavior   In your groups, use the graph to answer the following questions.     Back to work...  Our final goal will be to sketch a qualitatively accurate line graph of a stock's value over time whose behavior is directed by the logistic model.    Step 1: Stabilizing\/Amplifying, Increasing\/Decreasing   Work in your group to match each population over time graph below to the correct description.  Write a short summary explaining your choices.      We now have all the pieces needed to sketch a graph of a population over time which follows a logistic model. Let's start with the example from , whose net flow was given by . You'll want to reference the graph in the figure for the next activity.    Logistic Line Graphs   Work in your group to sketch a line graph of the population over time for each of the initial population values , , and . When you have graphs your group agrees upon, use the interactive provided to check your work.      In what ways is the line graph for the logistic model similar to that of the exponential model? In what ways is it different?      Let's continue to practice modeling using the logistic model.    Logistic Equations and Graphs   Below you will be given a growth rate and carrying capacity for a population. From that you will be asked to write the equation of the net flow rate using the logistic model. When this is correct, you will be asked to sketch the behavior of the population over time for different initial population values.      Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button. Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to translate the net flow rate in a logistic model to population behavior over time as if you were explaining it to someone new.     Note on Carrying Capacity  Do you wonder where the carrying capacity for a population comes from? It's possible to estimate this capacity with some initial measurements of a stock's value over time. If this is something you are interested in determining as part of a case study, please ask!   Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  How does the logistic model compare to the exponential model?  What are the equilibrium values in a logistic model?  What is the general behavior of a stock over time that follows the logistic model?     Section Checkpoint  Sign in to your Doenet course to complete the checkpoint questions.   "

The purpose of this activity is to determine how we can label an equilibrium value in a way that is descriptive of how the stock values behave around it.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     describe the stability of equilibrium values in a continuous dynamical system.  describe the stability of equilibrium values in a discrete dynamical system.    Let's get to work...  Imagine a system whose stock is currently in equilibrium. Then imagine some outside force nudging that stock value out of equilibrium. How will the stock behave now? The answer to this question is what we will generally refer to as the equilibrium value's stability . To start gaining an intutitve understanding of this concept, work through the following thought exercise in your group.    Stability Introduction   The images below represent three different systems in equilibrium. The stock value being measured is the red ball's position in space, and since all three balls are balanced and not moving on their respective surfaces, each ball is in equilibrium. Now imagine that a gust of wind blows over each system.  If the wind blows so that each ball moves just slightly to the right, describe how you think the ball will behave afterwards.  If the wind blows so that each ball moves just slightly to the left, describe how you think the ball will behave afterwards.        Your answers to the above questions are examples of the types of behavior we may see in real-world systems. While the behavior of real-world systems can be much more complicated than what we've described so far, our goal for this section will be to describe some common behaviors for the types of systems we've discussed in previous sections.  Recall from the distinction between  continuous dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken continuously over time, and are visually represented by line graphs, and  discrete dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken over equally spaced time intervals, and are visually represented by scatter plots.    When analyzing the behavior of systems nudged out of equilibrium, it is important for us to distinguish between these two types of models, as this can impact the types of behavior we can see.   Back to work...  First, we will explore stock behavior around equilibrium values in continuous dynamical systems.    Stability In Continuous Dynamical Systems   In your group, use the graphs below to answer the following questions.       An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 1 is called a stable equilibrium value. An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 2 is called an unstable equilibrium value.   The behavior around stable equilibrium values is reminiscent of the first system in , while the behavior around unstable equilibrium values is reminiscent of the second system in .    Half-Stable Equilibria   In your group, do the following:      Construct a line graph for the Net Flow with respect to Stock value that you think would result in behavior around the equilibrium value that is reminiscent of the third system in . We will call equilibrium values with this behavior half-stable .       Make a conjecture (this means an educated prediction) about how you could tell whether an equilibrium value was stable or unstable in a continuous dynamical system based off of its net flow rate line graph.      Back to work...  Now, we will explore stock behavior around equilibrium values in discrete dynamical systems. Recall that the only difference in this context is that stock measurements are taken at equally spaced intervals instead of continuously over time. There will be many similarities in the behavior that we saw in the continous case, but also some differences. Let's work through some examples to explore the discrete case in more detail.  In the discrete case, because measurements are taken on a set interval, we have to be a bit more specific than we were in the continuous case. It may not be sufficient to say that the stock is just increasing or decreasing. We may need to describe in more detail by how much the stock is increasing or decreasing. We can use the Net Flow rate information to help us do this.  For example, suppose the net flow rate for a stock is given by units per minute, and we are taking stock measurements every minute. If the current stock value is units, than units will be added to to get the new stock value after one minute. That is, if the current stock value is units, we can compute the next stock value after one minute with the computation     Stability in Discrete Dynamical Systems   In the following examples, work in your group to make similar computations. You will keep track of your results in a table, and also see the visual representation as a scatter plot to help with your analysis.      In your group, write down a conjecture (this means an educated prediction) about how you could tell what the behavior of an equilibrium value will be in a discrete dynamical system based off of its net flow rate line graph.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What does the stability of an equilibrium value tell us about the behavior of a stock?  In what ways is the behavior around equilibrium values similar between discrete and continuous dynamical systems?  In what ways is the behavior around equilibrium values different between discrete and continuous dynamical systems?

We will now add pollution from agricultural run-off as a parameter to our model, which impacts the inflow rate of phosphorus:    The system diagram for the amount of phosphorus in a lake with a parameter added for pollution from agricultural run-off.   The system diagram indicates that an increase in pollution will increase the inflow rate, and therefore increase the net flow rate for the stock. This is represented graphically below. Take a moment to play with the parameter slider and verify that for a fixed level of phosphorus, as pollution increases, the net flow increases as well.    The line graph for the net flow rate of phosphorus, along with a slider to change the parameter value of pollution. As polution increases, the net flow rate graph is shifted up.   Notice that as the pollution parameter changes, so do the equilibrium values. Measuring how parameters impact equilibrium values can be an important measurement for dynamical systems.   Let be an equilibrium value of a stock when a parameter has value . Suppose that if the parameter value is changed by a small amount If you're asking yourself what amount is considered small , that's a great question! This can be made more precise with tools f rom calculus, but for our purposes, we won't be too picky here. In general, the closer you can make the two parameter values, the more accurate your computation will be. to , the equilbrium value of the stock changes to . Then the sensitivity of to the parameter is the number .   For our next exercise, let's zoom in on on our net flow rate graph from above to focus on the phosphorus equilibrium value of when the pollution parameter is .    Sensitivity   Work in your group to fill out the following table to compute the sensitivities to pollution at various equilibrium values.  Use the first graph to set your initial pollution value, and find the associated initial phosphorus equilibrium value by either moving the point on the horizontal axis, or setting the value manually so that the net flow rate is . Similarly, use the second graph to set your next pollution value, and find the associated next phosphorus equilibrium value.  The first row is completed for you to use as a guide.      Once your table is completed correctly, discuss the following questions in your group.  How do the sensitivities change as pollution values change?  Are there pollution values that can change the number of equilibrium values in the system? How does this seem to be connected to sensitivities?       Back to work...  For the next exercise, use the graph and slider from .    Tipping Points   Place the pollution parameter slider in to , and answer the following questions in your group.      The previous discussion illustrates that it is possible, in systems with parameters, that there are special parameter values that, if exceeded even by the smallest amount, can cause significant changes to the system. We give these parameter values a special name.   A parameter value in which any increase or decrease to the value causes a change in the number of equilibrium values of the stock is a called a tipping point value .   Our final exercise will help explore system behavior around tipping point values.    Tipping Point Behaviors      What are the tipping point values for the parameter ?      Imagine the phosphrus stock is in equilibrium when at a phosphorus value of . If the parameter value exceeds the tipping point value closest to , how will the phosphorus value change?      If the parameter value exceeds the tipping point value closest to , is it possible for the phosphorus value to return to an equilibrium value of ?         What are the tipping point values for the parameter ?      Imagine the phosphrus stock is in equilibrium when at a phosphorus value of . If the parameter value exceeds the tipping point value which is larger than , how will the phosphorus value change?      If the parameter value exceeds the tipping point value which is larger than , is it possible for the phosporus value to return to an equilibrium value of less than ?      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What does the sensitivity of a stock value to a parameter measure?  How is the sensitivity of a stock value to a parameter related to tipping point values of a parameter?  Why are tipping point values important?  What other systems do you think may contain tipping point values?     Section Checkpoint  Sign in to your Doenet course to complete the checkpoint questions.   "

  "title": "Describing Data",
  "body": " Describing Data   Mathematical models will never be good enough to provide absolute certainty about how a real-world system will behave. Therefore, it is important to think critically about what information they do provide, and how we choose to use that information. Models typically begin with large amounts of data. The purpose of this activity is to understand some basic tools that can be used to summarize and understand a data set.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     use descriptive statistics like the mean, median, and interquartile range to describe a numerical data set.  represent a data set visually with a box plot.    Let's get to work...  A data set is a collection of objects (like people, countries, etc.) for which one or more measurements (like the height of a person, a country's GDP, etc.) are taken. Each type of measurement is called a variable in the data set. If the value of a variable is text from a list (like a person's ethnicity), that variable is called categorical . If the value of a variable is a number (like a person's height in inches), that variable is called numerical . We will focus on understanding data sets with numerical variables.    Data Collection   First we will work together to generate a data set for our class. We will collect values for three numerical variables.  Height : your height measured in inches  Number of moves : the number of times you have moved residences  Power test score : your score on the the 30 second power test . There are modifications available for this test.    Enter your data on this shared spreadsheet . You do not need to include your name.  Copy and paste the data set from the shared spreadsheet to the spreadsheet below. This copy will be for your individual use for the remainder of the activity.      Describing Data Part 1   Use the data set to first answer these questions individually, and then discuss your responses as a group.  Is our class tall?  Has our class moved a lot?  How does our class perform on the 30 second power test?       Each of these questions face a similar challenge: needing to summarize a large group of individual responses into a single response that is a good representation of them all. While there is no single best approach to this type of challenge, there are some standard metrics that can be used that can help give us a good understanding of a numerical data set. One approach is to calculate a single number that describes the center value of all of the values that a numerical variable takes in the data set.   The mean value (or average value ) of a numerical variable is the sum of all values divided by the total number of values, .  The median value of a numerical variable is the middle value when all values are arranged in increasing order. If there is an even number of values (so there are two values and in the middle), then the median value is the mean of the middle two, .   When your data set is in a spreadsheet, you can typically use the following commands in a cell to calculate these values. If the numerical values of your data set are in column A, rows 1 through 10, then  to compute the mean value, enter =average(A1:A10) .  to compute the median value, enter =median(A1:A10) .      Describing Data Part 2   Practice using these commands in your spreadsheet to compute the mean and median for each of the three variables in the data set. In your group, discuss how you might use these values to answer the questions from .    Back to work...  All three data sets below have a mean value of .         Analyzing the Mean   Discuss the following questions in your groups regarding the data sets A, B, and C.  Which data set is best described by a mean value of . Why?  For the remaining two data sets, why is the mean value not as good at describing the set of values? Does the median value do better?       Besides attempting to describe the center value of a numerical data set, it can also be useful to describe how spread out the values are. As we saw above, data sets can have the same mean, median, or both, and be very different from one another. One standard way There is another descriptive measurement called the standard deviation which we will not discuss in this section. It measures how spread out values are from the mean value. to describe the spread of a numerical variable is to compute the interquartile range of that variable.   The lower quartile for a numerical variable is the median of the lower half of the values for that variable (not including the median itself).  The upper quartile for a numerical variable is the median of the upper half of the values for that variable (not including the median itself).  The interquartile range for a numerical variable is the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile for that variable.   It can also be important to recognize values of a variable that are outside of the normal spread . These values are called outliers .   An outlier is a value of a numerical variable that is either more than times the interquartile range above the upper quartile, or more than times the interquartile range below the lower quartile.     Quartiles and Outliers   Answer the following questions in your group regarding data sets A, B, and C.     Back to work...  We saw in that visual representations can be very useful for communicating patterns in measurements. There are also useful visuals for communicating the descriptive statistics of the values of a numerical variable that we've discussed in this section. One such visual is called a box plot .    Box Plots   Examples of box plots for data sets A and B are given below. In your group, discuss how the box plots communicate each of the descriptive statistics that we've computed above, and how the visual representation is helpful in interpreting these statistics.      The width of the box in a box plot is determined by the interquartile range, and it is positioned to begin at the lower quartile and end at the upper quartile.  The median is indicated with a vertical line segment inside the box.  The mean is indicated with a red sqaure.  Horizontal lines are drawn to indicate if there are values in the data set that are not outliers, but are above or below the upper and lower quartiles.  Outliers in the data set are indicated with orange triangles.    Creating Box Plots   Work in your group to create box plots for each variable we collected data for in our class data set. Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful in recalling the various components that comprise a box plot.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are some descriptive ways that we can understand a large numerical data set?  After this activity, how would you answer the questions about our class data set ?     Section Checkpoint  There are no checkpoint questions for this section.   "

  "body": " Visualizing Data   When using data to help inform the likelihood of a specific outcome, it is helpful to know the number of occurrences of that outcome in your data set. This is called the frequency of that outcome, and is a property that our current summaries and visuals have not highlighted. The purpose of this activity is to learn how to visually represent a data set to highlight frequencies, and to use that visual to make qualitative interpretations.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     represent the distribution of numerical data with a frequency histogram.  recognize when a distribution is skewed and interpret its implications.  recognize common distribution shapes.    Let's get to work...  The distribution of a numerical variable is an organization of that variable's values that illustrates how often (i.e., the frequency) different types of values occur. A frequency histogram is one standard visual representation for distributions of a numerical variable, which we will illustrate next.    Introduction to Frequency Histograms   Let's begin by gathering data for a numerical variable. Copy and paste your data for the Height variable from our shared spreadsheet . Copy only numerical values (not the title text).      Frequency Distributions Part 1   In your group, discuss the following questions.  How would you describe the shape of the distribution for this variable?  What do you think the shape tells us about student heights in our class?  In what ways might the shape of a distribution be related to predicting the likelihood of a specific outcome? (e.g., If you had to guess the height of a randomly chosen student from our class, what would you guess?)      Back to work...     Building Frequency Histograms   Use the space below to construct the frequency table and frequency histogram for the remaining two variables from our shared spreadsheet ( Number of Moves and Power Test Score ). For each frequency histogram, discuss the following questions in your group.  How would you describe the shape of the distribution for this variable?  What do you think the shape tells us about this variable's values for students in our class?       Back to work...     Frequency Distributions Part 2   Below are frequency histograms of some common distributions. Use them to discuss the following questions in your group.

  "title": "Probability Models",
  "body": " Probability Models   In the previous section we saw how visualizing data can help inform our intuition regarding the likelihood of specific outcomes. The purpose of this activity is to formalize this idea by introducing probability models.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     identify a probability model for a random experiment.  compute basic probabilities for events from a probability model.    Let's get to work...  Many games that we play are interesting because they contain a level of uncertainty. For example, the outcome of rolling a dice cannot be known for certain until it happens. This is also the nature of many events in life. We cannot know with complete certainty today what the weather will be tomorrow, what our crop yield will be in months, or what our city's population will grow to next year. This does not, however, mean that we are unable to say something meaningful in these situations. An event with an uncertain outcome is referred to as a random experiment , and the language used to make meaningful observations about random experiments is called probability .  As a first example, let's return to the random experiment of rolling a dice and make some important observations.  Assuming we are rolling a single six-sided dice, there are only six possible outcomes: rolling a , , , , , or . The set of all possible outcomes in a random experiment is called the sample space of the random experiment.  Any subset of the sample space is an event of the random experiment. For example, rolling an even number is an event of rolling a dice.  We can assign a number to each outcome in the sample space which represents how likely that outcome is to occur. These numbers are between and and can be interpreted as the percentage likelihood of that outcome, called the probability of that outcome. Probabilities may be determined from properties that define the random experiment or from a computational model describing the experiment. For rolling a six-sided dice, we could assign a probablility of ( ) to each outcome. This reflects the fact that each outcome occurs on exactly one of six sides of the dice, and that we assume each outcome is equally likely to occur. We would call this dice a fair dice; a dice in which some outcomes are more likely than others would be called a weighted dice.  The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space should always be ( ). In the example of rolling a dice, there are six outcomes (rolling a , , , , , or ), each with a probability of . So if we add the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space we get .  A sample space with associated probabilities that sum to is referred to as a probability model for a random experiment.      Probability Models   In your group, determine a probability model (i.e., the sample space and probabilities of outcomes) for each random experiment below.      Flipping a (fair) quarter      Flipping two (fair) quarters      Flipping a (weighted) quarter in which heads is twice as likely as tails      Rolling two (fair) dice      Back to work...  We are generally interested in probabilities of one or more events of a random experiment that are not just single outcomes of a random experiment (e.g., what is the proability of rolling an even number when rolling a fair six-sided dice?). We will discover some basic rules we can use to answer these questions using the probablities of outcomes from a probability model.    Basic Probability Rules   In your group, discuss the following questions related to the random experiment of rolling two (fair) six-sided dice.      There is also a general rule for the probability of event A AND event B of a random experiment happening (called the intersection of two events): This is true as long as the two events are independent . Two events are independent if knowing whether or not one event happened does not give any new information about how likely the other event is to happen. Here are a few examples:  The events flipping a heads on the first flip and flipping a heads on the second flip are independent. Knowing that I flipped a heads on the first flip does not change the probability of flipping a heads on the second flip.  The events rolling an even number and rolling a number or less in the same roll are independent events. The probability of rolling a number or less is . If we now know that the roll was an even number, the set of outcomes changes to , , or . Two out of three of these outcomes is or less, so the probability of rolling a number or less (even with the knowledge that the roll was even) is still .  The events rolling an even number and rolling a number or less in the same roll are not independent events. The probability of rolling a number or less is . If we now know that the roll was an even number, the set of outcomes changes to , , or . One out of three of these outcomes is or less, so the probability of rolling a number or less (with the knowledge that the roll was even) has changed to .      Using Probability Rules   We will now practice computing probabilites using the rules we've just established. Use the probability models provided to answer each question.     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  Why are random experiments relevant to questions of sustainability?  How do we use probability models to describe the uncertainty of a random experiment?  How can we use probabilities of outcomes in a sample space to compute probabilities of events and combinations of events?

  "title": "The Law of Large Numbers",
  "body": " The Law of Large Numbers   When it is possible to repeat a random experiment many times, we can use this sampling data (instead of a model) to approximate probabilities of outcomes in the sample space. The purpose of this activity is to practice using frequency data to estimate probabilities, and to illustrate how increasing the number of samples we use makes our estimates better.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     create a probability density histogram from frequencies.  explain how the law of large numbers can be used to approximate probabilities.    Let's get to work...  In we used frequency histograms of numerical data to give us a visual of how that data is distributed. In we saw how we could describe data from a random experiment using the language of probability. It is possible to combine these ideas into a probability density histogram (or just density histogram ), which gives a visual of how probabilities are distributed over the sample space of a random experiment. We will describe the process of creating a density histogram with an example.  Suppose you are interested in measuring arsenic levels in a large water reservoir. As a random experiment, this could be framed as drawing a one liter sample and testing the arsenic concentration in parts per billion (ppb) of that sample. The outcomes in the sample space could be ppb, ppb, ppb, and ppb.  In the random experiment of rolling a pair of dice, we used our knowledge of every possible roll to determine the probabilities of outcomes in the sample space. Similarly, in order to know the true probablities of each outcome in the sample space of the lake draws, we would have to have knowledge of every possible one liter sample from the reservoir. Unlike rolling a pair of dice, this is not feasible to do in reality. In these instances it can be useful to approximate the probability of an outcome by computing a relative frequency . While we can't draw every possible one liter sample from the reservoir, we can draw several different samples (i.e., repeat our experiment multiple times).   If we repeat an experiment times, and an outcome has a frequency of , then the relative frequency of that outcome is defined to be .   The relative frequency of an outcome is a number between and , and can be thought of as an approximation of the probability of the outcome.  For example, suppose we draw one liter samples from the reservoir. shows frequencies and relative frequencies for each outcome in our sample space.     Outcome  Frequency  Relative Frequency    ppb      ppb      ppb      ppb       Notice that the sum of the frequencies is the total number of samples, and the sum of the relative frequencies is ( ).    Introduction to Density Histograms   A density histogram is a histogram which communicates the relative frequencies (e.g., ) instead of the actual frequencies (e.g., ). A density histogram for our example of one liter samples is below.      In your group, answer the following question: how are the relative frequencies of each outcome being communicated in the histogram?    What is the area of each rectangle in the histogram? What is the sum of the areas of all of the rectangles in the histogram?      A common misinterpretation of density histograms is to read the height of each rectangle as the relative frequency of that outcome. This is only true if the bin width of each outcome is . In general, the relative frequencies of outcomes are communicated in density histograms through the areas of rectangles.     Using Relative Frequencies to Create Density Histograms   Suppose you and your group collect new samples, given by the table below. Compute the relative frequencies of each outcome. Then create a frequency histogram and a density histogrm for the data.       Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button. Before moving on, do at least 2 different variations, and write down an explanation for how to compute the relative frequency of an outcome and create a density histogram as if you were explaining it to someone new.      Do you think the shapes of the frequency histograms are related to the shapes of density histograms?      Back to work...  We've seen that we can approximate probabilities of outcomes by computing relative frequencies. What if we would like to get a better approximation than what we currently have? It seems intuitive that we should increase our sample size (i.e., repeat the experiment more times). After all, the more samples we have, the more information we have about the outcomes in our sample space. This intuition can be confirmed and made more precise with the Law of Large Numbers , which we will illustrate below with several examples.    Law of Large Numbers Part 1   Let's first explore a random experiment that we are already familiar with: flipping a fair coin. Use the interactive provided to answer the questions below and discuss in your group.      The shared spreadsheet illustrates another important fact in probability called the Central Limit Theorem. Intuitively, it says that for large sample sizes, the distribution of the averages of those samples is normally distributed with a mean approximately equal to the true mean.   Back to work...  Intuitively, the Law of Large Numbers says that if we repeat a random experiment many times, then the density histogram of relative frequencies will almost certainly approach the density histogram which reflects the true probabilities of the outcomes of the random experiment.  In our example of flipping a coin, we saw this illustrated in that as we increased the number of flips, the density histogram began to consistently reflect the uniform distribution in which each outcome has probability . This can be most powerful, however, for random experiments in which we cannot in practice determine the true probability density histogram, such as our example of collecting water samples from a reservoir.    Law of Large Numbers Part 2   Below is another interactive which allows you to (virtually) collect water samples from a reservoir, and returns the concentration of arsenic (in ppb) of your samples, as well as a density histogram of your samples. In your group, use the interactive along with the Law of Large Numbers to write a statement regarding your opinion about the arsenic levels in the reservoir. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, arsenic levels in drinking water should be less than ppb .     Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  How can we estimate probabilities of outcomes in a random experiment?  How does the Law of Large Numbers help us understand uncertainty related to a random experiment?  What would be a good template sentence to use to communicate relative frequencies obtained from a large number of samples?

  "title": "Game Theory",
  "body": " Game Theory   We've discussed several tools for analyzing data, predicting change, and assessing risk to better understand the behavior of systems around us. Ultimately, we must use this information to make decisions. The purpose of this activity is to introduce how mathematics can be used to help understand outcomes in a network of multiple decision-makers.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...     understand how an interaction between two decision-makers can be modeled mathematically with a game.  interpret a payoff matrix for a game to predict the outcome.    Let's get to work...   We must make a decision can be a daunting phrase in many contexts. It is easy to think that the decision itself is the complex part, requiring analysis of many factors and variables using tools such as we've discussed up to this point. A goal of our final chapter is to consider the complexity introduced by we . Outcomes in sustainability contexts are usually the result of decisions made by multiple connected individuals with varying needs and values, not a decision made by a single individual. The we can range widely in scope, from a school's decisions about how to re-use and re-cycle materials, to the world's decisions about how to respond to current levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Regardless of the scope, outcomes resulting from decisions made by a we are more complex to predict and understand than outcomes resulting from decisions made by an individual.  One of the most prevalent approaches that we have seen in modern history was introduced by economist Adam Smith in 1776, describing an individual merchant:   ...by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, page 199   This statement was made in the context of economics, but the philosophy is easily extended to any context which involves multiple decision-makers, and provides one strategy and claim for sustainability decisions that involve multiple individuals: if you, as an individual, regard only your own self-interest and all other individuals do the same, then typically an unintended biproduct will be that the overall outcome is, in some sense, best for all.   Game theory is a field of mathematics that can help us analyze scenarios in which there are multiple decision-makers whose decisions affect each other. We will introduce the basic concepts here to analyze in more detail the underlying philosophy in Smith's statement above.  Let's begin with an example to introduce the important definitions. In the game rock, paper, scissors , there are two players that make a choice of which element they'd like to play, and then they display those elements simultaneously. The outcome of the game is determined by the following hierarchy:  rock beats scissors,  scissors beats paper, and  paper beats rock.    If the players play the same object, the game would be considered a draw. If we were keep score, we could award a for a win, a for a loss, and a for a draw. We can organize all possible outcomes for the game in the following table, where the entries are organized as (Player A's payoff, Player B's payoff).         Rock, Paper, Scissors  B plays rock  B plays scissors  B plays paper    A plays rock             A plays scissors             A plays paper              Let's make some important observations about this game.  This game contains more than one player, each of which is free to choose between multiple decisions, and each player's satisfaction with the outcome depends on the decision made by the other player.  Each player has knowledge of every player's satisfaction with every possible outcome. In other words, each player knows , which is called the payoff matrix for the game.  Any situation containing the above elements is considered a game . Note that this is more general than just the contexts that we typically think of as a game , like athletics or board games. For simplicity, we will focus on two player games, which will simplify our analysis yet still allow us to make some important observations about the outcomes of games.  If player A makes a choice, then a choice for player B which gives them the highest payoff given player A's choice is called a best response . For example, if player A chooses rock (so we are in the top row of the payoff matrix), a best response for player B is to choose paper ( is the best payoff in the second coordinate of the entries in row 1). An important part of predicting the outcome of games will be to consider each player's best responses, and also their knowledge of the the other player's best responses. We will assume that each player will act according to Smith's quote. That is, each player will attempt to make a decision that is best for their own self-interst, and they know the other player will do the same.    The rock, paper, scissors game also has the property that whatever one player gains, the other loses. This is called a zero sum game. Let's look at another example of a game which is not a zero sum game.    Analyzing a Payoff Matrix   Suppose you and a classmate have a final project to complete. Half of this project is to be completed individually, while the other half of the project is to be completed jointly. You have to decide which part of the project you will prioritize over the next week, and you are not able to discuss your decision with your partner. Your decision has the following payoffs:  If you both work on the joint project, you will earn for that portion, but only for the individual portion. That is, your total grade will be .  If one of you works on the joint project, but and the other works on the individual project, then the partner working on the individual project will earn for the individual portion, and the partner working on the joint project will earn for the individual portion. You both would earn on the joint portion. So the partner working on the individual portion would earn an , while the partner working on the joint portion would earn a .  If you both work on your individual projects, then you both will earn for that portion, but only for the joint portion. That is, your total grade will be .    Take a moment in your group to verify that this information is organized accurately in the following payoff matrix for this game.         Partner Project  B works on joint project  B works on individual project    A works on joint project          A works on individual project             Use to answer the following questions in your group.       The outcome of the previous game is referred to as the prisoner's dilemma , because it is similar to the game in which a team of prisoners is separated and they each have a choice of confessing the other's crimes, or remaining silent. The payoff matrix for this game is as follows, with payoffs listed as years in prison.        Prisoner's Dilemma  B Confesses  B Silent    A Confesses          A Silent             The Prisoner's Dilemma   Answer the following questions in your group.      When at least one player has a single dominant choice, we can predict the outcome of the game. This is because both players have knowledge of the payoff matrix. If player A has a dominant choice, then player B knows what that is and knows that player A will choose it. Therefore, player B will make whatever choice is a best response to player A's dominant choice.     Dominant Choices   Now we will practice more determining when a player in a game has a dominant choice, and using this to predict the outcome of the game. Two players can play a red card or blue card. The payoff matrix below shows the monetary payoff for every choice.      Choose new variations of the payoff matrix with the New Variation button. Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to determine when a player has a dominant choice as if you were explaining it to someone new.     Back to work...  We will look at one more case when we are able to predict the outcome of a game. To help us do so, let's make an observation about the cases we've been able to predict so far, when at least one player has a dominant choice.  Let's return to the game in . We could make a table of best responses for both players:    If A chooses...  B's best response is...    Joint Project  Individual Project    Individual Project  Individual Project      If B chooses...  A's best response is...    Joint Project  Individual Project    Individual Project  Individual Project    Let's make some important observations about these tables.  Organized this way, we can see that player B has a dominant choice of Individual Project because that is the only response listed in player B's best response column. The same is true for player A.  We can also see that the of choice Individual Project for each partner is unique in another way: it is the only pair of choices which is a best response to the other. That is, if partner A chooses Individual Project , partner B's best response is Individual Project , and vice versa. A pair of choices with this property (that they are both best responses to the other) is called a Nash equilibrium .    Nash equilibria can occur even when neither player has a dominant choice. They are important to identify because they are a combination of choices in which no player can benefit from making a different choice, assuming all other players' choices stay the same. So if a game reaches a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to make a different choice (this is why we refer to choices that meet this property as an equilibrium ). When there is a single Nash equilibrium in a game, we expect that players making decisions based only on their own individual gain will make the choice corresponding to that equilibrium. Let's look at a final example.    Nash Equilibria   Suppose country A and country B share three polluted reservoirs. They each can make a decision as to which reservoir to clean up and maintain. The payoff in terms of quality of life for each choice is given in . A higher number means a higher quality of life.          Shared Pollution 1  B cleans reservoir 1  B cleans reservoir 2  B cleans reservoir 3    A cleans reservoir 1             A cleans reservoir 2             A cleans reservoir 3                Complete the table of best responses for this game, and use it to answer the questions that follow.      Multiple Nash Equilibria  Outcomes of games with multiple Nash equilibria can depend on other factors relevant to the game. Consider a game with two countries that share a single reservoir. They can choose to pollute the reservoir for economic gain, or not. The payoff matrix showing the quality of life for each country is given below.        Shared Pollution 2  B Doesn't Pollute  B Pollutes    A Doesn't Pollute          A Pollutes             What are the Nash equilibria of this game?  What is required for the outcome to be one of the Nash equilibria?  What do you think will happen if the outcome is not a Nash equilibrium?  A game with this structure is referred to as a chicken game .   Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What are the important assumptions in game theory that allow us to predict outcomes in many games?  What can game theory help us understand about outcomes in situations when there are multiple decision-makers?

  "body": " The Commons   Many resources that are topics of sustainability can be used freely by many individuals. The purpose of this activity is to understand possible outcomes when multiple individuals freely use a shared resource over time.  The objectives of this activity are that you can...   Section Objectives   know what is meant by a commons and why it is relevant to questions of sustainability.  use game theory to model possible outcomes when individuals make decisions regarding the management of a commons.    Let's get to work...  A commons is any resource that is shared by a group and can be used freely by individuals in that group. Our daily life is filled with examples of uses of commons, and these resources are also often at the heart of sustainability questions.     Identifying Commons   In your group, brainstorm a list of as many resources as you can that would be considered a commons. Then discuss to what extent each resource on your list is relevant to sustainability.    Back to work...  We can view the management of a commons through the lens of game theory, where players are individuals of the group using the resource, and the decision each player has is how much of the resource they will use for themselves. We can do this through repeated games, where the decision to be made in a single game is should I use this resource again? . The final outcome will be achieved when all players decide they will stop using the resource. We will now use game theory tools to analyze outcomes when a commons is managed by individuals making decisions according to the assumptions we outlined in .    Tragedy of the Commons   Suppose there are two farmers (the players ) sharing an orchard (the commons). Each farmer can choose to plant a new fruit tree, which will deplete resources of the commons, but will also produce a fruit yield for the farmer.  The yield of a single fruit tree depends on how many total trees are planted. If more trees are planted, there are fewer resources available to a single tree, so the yield of a single tree will decrease as more trees are planted.      Choose new variations of the problem with the New Variation button. Complete at least 3 different versions, and write down a summary of the relationship between the social optimum outcome and the actual outcome predicted by game theory when managing a commons.     Back to work...  The tragedy of the commons refers to the phenomenon that occurs when individual rational choices lead to an overuse of a shared resource that makes everyone worse off. Unfortunately, this is not a phenomenon that is only observed in models. There are many examples of the tragedy of the commons in daily life, as well as potential future examples. Harvard Business   Helpful Professer     Managing the Commons   In your group, brainstorm some ideas for how you think the tragedy of the commons might be avoided.  How might the commons itself impact your solution?  How might the scale of the individuals involved impact your solution?    Then read through and discuss the brief summaries of some solutions that have been proposed and used in different contexts.   Managing the Commons  The following are examples of approaches to avoiding the tragedy of the commons.   Privatization . Make the commons no longer a shared resource. Divide the commons into parts, and give individuals ownership over those parts.   Regulation . Establish individual limits (legally or socially) on the use of the commons based on the social optimum use.   Cap and Trade . Establish an upper limit on the overall use of the commons based on the social optimum use. Individuals can buy and trade permits for the use of the commons up to a specified level. The number of permits issued is limited to ensure the upper limit is not exceeded.   Revenue-Neutral Use Tax . Individual users of the commons pay a tax proportional to how much they use the commons. The tax is collected and then re-distributed evenly to all individuals using the commons.      Reflection  Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.  What is a commons and why is it relevant to questions of sustainability?  What is the tragedy of the commons?     Section Checkpoint  There are no checkpoint questions for this section.   "

Some factors come from the facts involved, which is what we have spent much of our time learning tools for analyzing so far. We may also consider personal beliefs that are important to us (which we will refer to as core values ), or basic principles that we believe should be a common guide for our society (which we will refer to as community ethics ).    Individual Statement   Use the space below to draft an individual response to the following question.   When thinking about different decisions you could make to a specific question in sustainability, how would you measure whether or not a decision is a good decision?
