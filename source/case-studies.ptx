  <title>Case Studies</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The sections in this chapter are a guide for preparing each of your case study presentations.  
      Your case study presentation will be scored out of <m>30</m> points, assessed according to the following rubric. 
      Every category will be scored the same for your whole group, with the exception of the Peer Review category.
      Please use it as a reference while preparing for your presentation.
