    <title>The Law of Large Numbers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
           When it is possible to repeat a random experiment many times, we can use this sampling data (instead of a model) 
           to approximate probabilities of outcomes in the sample space. The purpose of this activity is to practice using 
           frequency data to estimate probabilities, and to illustrate how increasing the number of samples we use makes 
           our estimates better.

            In <xref ref="sec-5-2"/> we used frequency histograms of numerical data to give us a visual of how that data is 
            distributed. In <xref ref="sec-5-3"/> we saw how we could describe data from a random experiment using the 
            language of probability. It is possible to combine these ideas into a <term>probability density histogram</term> 
            (or just <term>density histogram</term>), which gives a visual of how probabilities are distributed over the 
            sample space of a random experiment. We will describe the process of creating a density histogram with an example.

            Suppose you are interested in measuring arsenic levels in a large water reservoir. As a random experiment, 
            this could be framed as drawing a one liter sample and testing the arsenic concentration in parts per billion 
            (ppb) of that sample. The outcomes in the sample space could be <m>0-5</m> ppb, <m>5-10</m> ppb, <m>10-15</m> ppb, 
            and <m>15-20</m> ppb.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the random experiment of rolling a pair of dice, we used our knowledge of every possible roll to determine the 
            probabilities of outcomes in the sample space. Similarly, in order to know the true probablities of each outcome 
            in the sample space of the lake draws, we would have to have knowledge of every possible one liter sample from 
            the reservoir. Unlike rolling a pair of dice, this is not feasible to do in reality. In these instances it 
            can be useful to approximate the probability of an outcome by computing a <term>relative frequency</term>. 
            While we can't draw every possible one liter sample from the reservoir, we can draw several different samples 
            (i.e., repeat our experiment multiple times).

                If we repeat an experiment <m>N</m> times, and an outcome has a frequency of <m>y</m>, then the 
                <term>relative frequency</term> of that outcome is defined to be <m>\frac{y}{N}</m>. 
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The relative frequency of an outcome is a number between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, and can be thought of as an 
            approximation of the probability of the outcome.
        </p>

            For example, suppose we draw <m>20</m> one liter samples from the reservoir. <xref ref="tab-ch5-rel-freq"/>
            shows frequencies and relative frequencies for each outcome in our sample space.

            Notice that the sum of the frequencies is the total number of samples, and the sum of the relative frequencies is

            A common misinterpretation of density histograms is to read the height of each rectangle as the relative 
            frequency of that outcome. This is only true if the bin width of each outcome is <m>1</m>. In general, 
            the relative frequencies of outcomes are communicated in density histograms through the <em>areas</em> of 
            rectangles.

            We've seen that we can approximate probabilities of outcomes by computing relative frequencies. What if we would 
            like to get a better approximation than what we currently have? It seems intuitive that we should increase our 
            sample size (i.e., repeat the experiment more times). After all, the more samples we have, the more information 
            we have about the outcomes in our sample space. This intuition can be confirmed and made more precise with the 
            <term>Law of Large Numbers</term>, which we will illustrate below with several examples.

                The shared spreadsheet illustrates another important fact in probability called the Central Limit Theorem. 
                Intuitively, it says that for large sample sizes, the distribution of the averages of those samples is normally 
                distributed with a mean approximately equal to the true mean.

            Intuitively, the Law of Large Numbers says that if we repeat a random experiment many times, then the density 
            histogram of relative frequencies will almost certainly approach the density histogram which reflects the true 
            probabilities of the outcomes of the random experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our example of flipping a coin, we saw this illustrated in that as we increased the number of flips, 
            the density histogram began to consistently reflect the uniform distribution in which each outcome has 
            probability <m>0.50</m>. This can be most powerful, however, for random experiments in which we cannot in 
            practice determine the true probability density histogram, such as our example of collecting water samples from 
            a reservoir.

            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.

                <li>
                    How does the Law of Large Numbers help us understand uncertainty related to a random experiment?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What would be a good template sentence to use to communicate relative frequencies obtained from a large 
                    number of samples?
