            <title>Introduction to Density Histograms</title>
    
            <introduction>
                <p>
                   A density histogram is a histogram which communicates the relative frequencies (e.g., <m>0.50</m>) 
                   instead of the actual frequencies (e.g., <m>10</m>). A density histogram for our example of <m>20</m> one 
                   liter samples is below.

                        In your group, answer the following question: how are the relative frequencies of each outcome 
                        being communicated in the histogram?

                    What is the area of each rectangle in the histogram? What is the sum of the areas of all of the 
                    rectangles in the histogram?

                   Suppose you and your group collect <m>20</m> new samples, given by the table below. Compute the relative

                     Let's first explore a random experiment that we are already familiar with: flipping a fair coin. 
                     Use the interactive provided to answer the questions below and discuss in your group.

                   Below is another interactive which allows you to (virtually) collect water samples from a reservoir, 
                   and returns the concentration of arsenic (in ppb) of your samples, as well as a density histogram of 
                   your samples. In your group, use the interactive along with the Law of Large Numbers to write a 
                   statement regarding your opinion about the arsenic levels in the reservoir. 
                   According to the Environmental Protection Agency, <url href="https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/drinking-water-arsenic-rule-history">arsenic levels in drinking water should be less than <m>10</m> ppb</url>.
