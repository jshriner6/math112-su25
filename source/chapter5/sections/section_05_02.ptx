    <title>Visualizing Data</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            When using data to help inform the likelihood of a specific outcome, it is helpful to know the number of 
            occurrences of that outcome in your data set. This is called the frequency of that outcome, and is a property 
            that our current summaries and visuals have not highlighted. The purpose of this activity is to learn how to 
            visually represent a data set to highlight frequencies, and to use that visual to make qualitative interpretations.

          <ol>
            <li>
                represent the distribution of numerical data with a frequency histogram.
            </li>
            <li>
                recognize when a distribution is skewed and interpret its implications.
            </li>
            <li>
                recognize common distribution shapes.

            The <term>distribution</term> of a numerical variable is an organization of that variable's values that 
            illustrates how often (i.e., the frequency) different types of values occur. A <term>frequency histogram</term> 
            is one standard visual representation for distributions of a numerical variable, which we will illustrate next.

                <p>The top left distribution is called a <term>bimodal distribution</term>.</p>
                <p>The top right distribution is called a <term>uniform distribution</term>.</p>
                <p>The middle left distribution is said to have a <term>right skew</term>.</p>
                <p>The middle right distribution is said to have a <term>left skew</term>.</p>
                <p>The bottom distribution is called a <term>normal distribution</term>.</p>

    <conclusion><title>Reflection</title>
        <p>
            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    How does a frequency histogram illustrate data differently from a box plot?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How is the distribution of a numerical variable related to predicting outcomes?
                </li>
            </ol>
