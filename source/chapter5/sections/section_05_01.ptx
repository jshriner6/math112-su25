    <title>Describing Data</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
           Mathematical models will never be good enough to provide absolute certainty about how a real-world system will 
           behave. Therefore, it is important to think critically about what information they do provide, and how we choose 
           to use that information. Models typically begin with large amounts of data. The purpose of this activity is to 
           understand some basic tools that can be used to summarize and understand a data set.

            A <term>data set</term> is a collection of objects (like people, countries, etc.) for which one or more 
            measurements (like the height of a person, a country's GDP, etc.) are taken. Each type of measurement is called 
            a <term>variable</term> in the data set. If the value of a variable is text from a list (like a person's ethnicity),
            that variable is called <term>categorical</term>. If the value of a variable is a number (like a person's 
            height in inches), that variable is called <term>numerical</term>. We will focus on understanding data sets 
            with numerical variables.

            Each of these questions face a similar challenge: needing to summarize a large group of individual responses 
            into a single response that is a <q>good</q> representation of them all. While there is no single best approach 
            to this type of challenge, there are some standard metrics that can be used that can help give us a good 
            understanding of a numerical data set. One approach is to calculate a single number that describes the 
            <em>center value</em> of all of the values that a numerical variable takes in the data set.

              The <term>mean value</term> (or <term>average value</term>) of a numerical variable is the sum of all values 
              divided by the total number of values, 
              <me>\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}</me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <term>median value</term> of a numerical variable is the middle value when all values are arranged in 
                increasing order. If there is an even number of values (so there are two values <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> in 
                the middle), then the median value is the mean of the middle two, 
                <me>\frac{x_1 +x_2}{2}</me>.

            When your data set is in a spreadsheet, you can typically use the following commands in a cell to calculate 
            these values. If the numerical values of your data set are in column A, rows 1 through 10, then
        
          <ul>
            <li>
                to compute the mean value, enter <c>=average(A1:A10)</c>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                to compute the median value, enter <c>=median(A1:A10)</c>. 
            </li>

            Besides attempting to describe the center value of a numerical data set, it can also be useful to describe how 
            spread out the values are. As we saw above, data sets can have the same mean, median, or both, and be very 
            different from one another. One standard way<footnote>There is another descriptive measurement called the 
            <term>standard deviation</term> which we will not discuss in this section. It measures how spread out values are 
            from the mean value.</footnote> to describe the spread of a numerical variable is to compute the 
            <term>interquartile range</term> of that variable.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
            The <term>lower quartile</term> for a numerical variable is the median of the lower half of the values for 
            that variable (not including the median itself).
            </p>
            <p>
            The <term>upper quartile</term> for a numerical variable is the median of the upper half of the values for 
            that variable (not including the median itself).
            </p>
            <p>
            The <term>interquartile range</term> for a numerical variable is the difference between the upper quartile 
            and the lower quartile for that variable.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            It can also be important to recognize values of a variable that are outside of the <q>normal spread</q>. 
            These values are called <term>outliers</term>.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
            An <term>outlier</term> is a value of a numerical variable that is either more than <m>1.5</m> 
            times the interquartile range above the upper quartile, or more than <m>1.5</m> times the interquartile 
            range below the lower quartile.

            We saw in <xref ref="sec-1-3"/> that visual representations can be very useful for communicating 
            patterns in measurements. There are also useful visuals for communicating the descriptive statistics of the 
            values of a numerical variable that we've discussed in this section. One such visual is called a 
            <term>box plot</term>.

    <remark>
        <p>
            The width of the box in a box plot is determined by the interquartile range, and it is positioned to 
            begin at the lower quartile and end at the upper quartile. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The median is indicated with a vertical line segment inside the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            The mean is indicated with a red sqaure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Horizontal lines are drawn to indicate if there are values in the data set that are not outliers, 
            but are above or below the upper and lower quartiles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outliers in the data set are indicated with orange triangles.
