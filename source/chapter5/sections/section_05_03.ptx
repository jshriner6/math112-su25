    <title>Probability Models</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
           In the previous section we saw how visualizing data can help inform our intuition regarding the likelihood of 
           specific outcomes. The purpose of this activity is to formalize this idea by introducing probability models.

            Many games that we play are interesting because they contain a level of uncertainty. For example, the outcome 
            of rolling a dice cannot be known for certain until it happens. This is also the nature of many events in life. 
            We cannot know with complete certainty today what the weather will be tomorrow, what our crop yield will be in 
            <m>3</m> months, or what our city's population will grow to next year. This does not, however, mean that we are 
            unable to say something meaningful in these situations. An event with an uncertain outcome is referred to as a 
            <term>random experiment</term>, and the language used to make meaningful observations about random experiments 
            is called <term>probability</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a first example, let's return to the random experiment of rolling a dice and make some important observations.
        
            <ul>
              <li>
                Assuming we are rolling a single six-sided dice, there are only six possible outcomes: rolling a <m>1</m>, 
                <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, <m>5</m>, or <m>6</m>. The set of all possible outcomes in a random experiment 
                is called the <term>sample space</term> of the random experiment. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Any subset of the sample space is an <term>event</term> of the random experiment. For example, rolling an 
                even number is an event of rolling a dice.
            </li>
            <li>
                We can assign a number to each outcome in the sample space which represents how likely that outcome is to 
                occur. These numbers are between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> and can be interpreted as the percentage likelihood of 
                that outcome, called the <term>probability</term> of that outcome. Probabilities may be determined from 
                properties that define the random experiment or from a computational model describing the experiment. For 
                rolling a six-sided dice, we could assign a probablility of <m>\frac{1}{6}</m> (<m>\approx 17 \%</m>) to 
                each outcome. This reflects the fact that each outcome occurs on exactly one of six sides of the dice, and 
                that we assume each outcome is equally likely to occur. We would call this dice a <term>fair</term> dice; 
                a dice in which some outcomes are more likely than others would be called a <term>weighted</term> dice. 
            </li>
            <li>The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space should always be <m>1</m> (<m>100 \%</m>). 
                In the example of rolling a dice, there are six outcomes (rolling a <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, 
                <m>5</m>, or <m>6</m>), each with a probability of <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>. So if we add the probabilities of 
                all outcomes in the sample space we get 
                <me>\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6} = 1</me>.
            </li>
            <li>
                A sample space with associated probabilities that sum to <m>1</m> is referred to as a 
                <term>probability model</term> for a random experiment.
            </li>

        <p>
            We are generally interested in probabilities of one or more events of a random experiment that are not just 
            single outcomes of a random experiment (e.g., what is the proability of rolling an even number when rolling a 
            fair six-sided dice?). We will discover some basic rules we can use to answer these questions using the 
            probablities of outcomes from a probability model.

        <p>
            There is also a general rule for the probability of <q>event A</q> AND <q>event B</q> of a random experiment 
            happening (called the <term>intersection</term> of two events):
            <me>P(A \text{ and } B)= P(A) \cdot P(B)</me>
            This is true as long as the two events are <term>independent</term>. Two events are <term>independent</term> 
            if knowing whether or not one event happened does not give any new information about how likely the other event 
            is to happen. Here are a few examples:
        
          <ul>
            <li>
                The events <q>flipping a heads on the first flip</q> and <q>flipping a heads on the second flip</q> are 
                independent. Knowing that I flipped a heads on the first flip does not change the probability of flipping a 
                heads on the second flip. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The events <q>rolling an even number</q> and <q>rolling a number <m>4</m> or less</q> in the same roll are 
                independent events. The probability of rolling a number <m>4</m> or less is <m>\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}</m>. 
                If we now know that the roll was an even number, the set of outcomes changes to <m>2</m>, <m>4</m>, or 
                <m>6</m>. Two out of three of these outcomes is <m>4</m> or less, so the probability of rolling a number 
                <m>4</m> or less (even with the knowledge that the roll was even) is still <m>\frac{2}{3}</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The events <q>rolling an even number</q> and <q>rolling a number <m>3</m> or less</q> in the same roll are 
                <em>not</em> independent events. The probability of rolling a number <m>3</m> or less is 
                <m>\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}</m>. If we now know that the roll was an even number, the set of outcomes changes 
                to <m>2</m>, <m>4</m>, or <m>6</m>. One out of three of these outcomes is <m>3</m> or less, 
                so the probability of rolling a number <m>3</m> or less (with the knowledge that the roll was even) 
                has changed to <m>\frac{1}{3}</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
