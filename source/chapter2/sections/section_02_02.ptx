    <title>Net Flow and Equilibrium</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Many natural systems have stocks that don't change, even though these systems are flowing constantly. 
            The purpose of this activity is to be able to recognize when stocks are in such a state.

            The objectives of this activity are that you can...

        <p>Let's return to our <xref ref="fig-sys-diagram" text="custom">system diagram for a bathtub system</xref> from 
            <xref ref="sec-2-1"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall that the arrows represent <term>flows</term> of the system, and the triangles represent processes that control the 
            <term>rate</term> of each flow. The system diagram helps us to understand the important components of a system and 
            how they are related, but to understand the behavior of the system we must also know the measurements involved: 
            the numerical values of the stocks and the rates, along with their units. Let's consider three examples.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The water volume is <m>100</m> gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is 
                    <m>1 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m>, and the outflow rate to the drain is 
                    <m>2 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{min}}</m>. In this scenario, the outflow rate is greater than the 
                    inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will decrease.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    The water volume is <m>100</m> gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is 
                    <m>2 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m>, and the outflow rate to the drain is 
                    <m>1 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{min}}</m>. In this scenario, the inflow rate is greater than the 
                    outflow rate, so over time the volume of water will increase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The water volume is <m>100</m> gallons. The inflow rate from the faucet is 
                    <m>1 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m>, and the outflow rate to the drain is 
                    <m>1 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{min}}</m>. In this scenario, the inflow rate is equal to the 
                    inflow rate, so over time the volume of water will remain at <m>100</m> gallons.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's make a few important observations about these examples.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In all of the examples we are comparing the inflow rates to the outflow rates to determine the 
                    qualitative behavior of the volume of water over time. To be more precise, we could calculate the 
                    <term>net flow rate</term>:
                    <me>\text{net flow rate}=\text{total inflow rate} - \text{total outflow rate}</me>
                    If there were multiple flows in the same direction, we would add them to get the total flow in that 
                    direction. A positive net flow for a stock means that stock is increasing over time, 
                    while a negative net flow for a stock means that stock is decreasing over time. 
                    Calculate the net flows for each example above, then check your answers below. Include units in your answer.

                            <li><m>1 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m></li>
                            <li><m>0 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m></li>
                        </ol>
                    </answer>
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the last example, the net flow is <m>0 \frac{\text{gallon}}{\text{min}}</m>. If a stock's net flow is 
                    <m>0</m>, we say that stock is in <term>equilibrium</term>. In this case, the equilibrium value of the 
                    stock is <m>100</m> gallons.

                    Our focus in this chapter will be mostly on systems in equilibrium. In general this will be more complex 
                    than what we've just considered. For example, flow rates may not be constant. We will re-visit systems 
                    not in equilibrium and how they change over time in chapter 4.

        <p>
            A stock in equilibrium is not changing in quantity. But as we've discussed, it is <em>moving</em>. 
            If the inflows and outflows for a stock are both non-zero, even when a stock may appear to be static, 
            the constant quantity is never comprised of the same <q>stuff</q>. There is a measure for the average time a 
            unit of stock will spend between inflow and outflow, which is what we will explore next.

                The <term>residence time</term> associated with a stock in equilibrium is the number 
                <me>\frac{\text{equilibrium value of stock}}{\text{flow rate to/from stock}}</me>.

    <conclusion><title>Reflection</title>
        <p>
            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What is the net flow rate of a stock, and why is it important in determining the behavior of a stock 
                    over time?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What does the residence time of a stock in equilibrium tell us about that stock? Be as specific as you can.
                </li>
