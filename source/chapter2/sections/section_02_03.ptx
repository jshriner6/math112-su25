    <title>Equilibrium Values</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          In real-world systems there are typically factors that influence the rates of flows within stock-flow models. 
          The purpose of this activity is to consider a common influence, and its impact on the value of a stock in equilibrium.
        </p>

            The objectives of this activity are that you can...

            Let's return once again to our <xref ref="fig-sys-diagram" text="custom">system diagram for a bathtub system</xref> from 
            <xref ref="sec-2-1"/>, with one small addition:

                A system diagram for the bathtub example showing stocks as squares, flows as arrows, flow rate processes as 
                triangles, and the dependency between water volume and the drain rate as a red link.

        </figure>
        <p>
            In this new diagram we've added a red <term>dependency link</term> between the water stock and the outflow 
            controlled by the drain. We've added this to indicate that the outflow is not, in fact, constant as we've 
            assumed in previous examples, but it varies depending on the water depth value: a larger water depth value will 
            result in a larger outflow rate through the drain.

        <title>Back to work...</title>
        <p>
            As with our previous system diagrams, so far we've just identified and represented something in the system that 
            will impact its behavior. To make dependency links useful in computation, we need to to know more specifically 
            what that dependency is as an equation. 
        </p>
        <p>
             We now ask the same question as in <xref ref="sec-2-2"/>: 
             is this stock in equilibrium? With flow rates that change, the answer is not as straightforward as when they were constant.
             We will return to our example of the bathtub system from the beginning of the section.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the sake of our example, let's assume that the inflow rate from the faucet is constant at <m>2.4</m> gallons 
            per minute, while the outflow rate <m>R</m> (in gallons per minute) is dependent on the water depth <m>d</m> 
            (in inches) by the equation
            <me>
              R = 0.6d
            </me>.
        </p>
        <remark><title>What are the units of the constant <m>0.6</m>?</title>
              <m>\frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{minute}\times \text{inches}}</m>
        </remark>
        <p>
            We know that the stock will be in equilibrium when its inflow rate and outflow rate are equal. 
            As an equation, that means that 
            <me>\underset{\text{inflow}}{2.4} = \underset{\text{outflow}}{R}</me>,
            or
            <me>2.4 = 0.6d</me>.
            We can solve for <m>d</m> by dividing both sides of the equation by <m>0.6</m> to get <m>d=\frac{2.4}{0.6} = 4</m> 
            inches. This now gives us information to understand how our system will behave.
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If our initial water volume is such that the depth is less than <m>4</m> inches, then initially the 
                    inflow rate of <m>2.4</m> gallons per minute will be greater than the outflow rate <m>R</m> (why?). 
                    Therefore the net flow rate will be positive, and the water volume will increase until it reaches a depth 
                    of <m>4</m> inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If our initial water volume is such that the depth is greater than <m>4</m> inches, then initially the 
                    inflow rate of <m>2.4</m> gallons per minute will be less than the outflow rate <m>R</m> (why?). 
                    Therefore the net flow rate will be negative, and the water volume will decrease until it reaches a depth 
                    of <m>4</m> inches, at which point it will be in equilibrium.
                </li>

                    If our initial water volume is such that the depth is equal to <m>4</m> inches, then initially the 
                    inflow rate of <m>2.4</m> gallons per minute will equal the outflow rate <m>R</m>. Therefore the net 
                    flow will be zero, and the water volume will remain constant.

    <conclusion><title>Reflection</title>
        <p>
            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What are dependency links and why are they important in stock-flow models?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why is it more challenging to compute the equilibrium value of a stock if the flow rates are not constant?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you think that stock values will always change towards an equilibrium value?
                </li>
            </ol>
