                    Let's practice computing the net flow of a stock.

                        The following system diagram is for the stock of atmospheric carbon, measured in gigatons (GT). 
                        The flows are measured in GT per year. We are accounting for inflows from plants (plant respiration), 
                        sea (air/sea gas exchange), soil (microbial respiration and decomposition), and humans 
                        (human emissions), and for outflows to plants (photosynthesis) and sea (air/sea gas exchange).

                    Choose new variations of the model by selecting the 
                    <q>New Variation</q> button. 
                    Before moving on, get at least 3 correct in a row, and write down an explanation for how to compute net 
                    flow and what that means for the behavior of a stock as if you were explaining it to someone new.

                            Consider a stock-flow model whose stock is number of undergraduate students at a University, 
                            with a single inflow of admitted students and a single outflow of graduating students. 
                            Assuming this stock is in equilibrium, calculate the residence time of the stock for each 
                            scenario below. Discuss its meaning in the context of the model.
