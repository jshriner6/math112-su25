    <introduction>
        <p>
           In real-world systems there may be factors which are not stocks within the system, but still influence the rates 
           of flows within stock-flow models. The purpose of this activity is to consider these factors.

            One description of the system above could be a cup of coffee sitting on a table. Considered as a stock-flow model, 
            we could say that the stock is the temperature of the coffee<fn>Technically you might say that our stock measures the 
            amount of heat energy in the coffee, but since we can relate temperature directly to the heat energy, 
            it is OK (and maybe more intuitive) to use temperature as a measurement in its place.</fn> (in degrees Celsius), 
            and the only flow is the outflow of heat (measured in degrees Celsius per minute).
        </p>  
        <p>
            In this example, the outflow rate will be dependent not only on the value of the stock, but also on
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    the outside temperature that the cup of coffee is exposed to. It will cool faster if it's sitting outside in 
                    cold weather than if it's sitting inside on a counter at room temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the insulation properties of the cup holding the coffee. It will stay warmer longer if it's in a glass container 
                    than it would if it's in a metal container.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            From the perspective of the stock-flow model, these two factors do not fit into any component we've discussed so far. 
            They are not stocks (quantities that are being added to or taken from) and they are not flows. We define these new 
            components that we may want to account for in stock-flow models now.
        </p>
        
        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>parameter</term> in a stock-flow model is a quantity that affects one or more flow rate in the model, 
                and is constant for a fixed model.
            </p>  
        </definition>
        
        <p>
          In the coffee cup example, the outside temperature and the insulation properties of the cup are both parameters. 
          These values don't change for a fixed model (if the coffee cup is outside in a ceramic mug, these values are 
          constants), but their values nevertheless will impact how the temperature behaves. In a system diagram, we will 
          represent parameters with rectangles, and indicate the flow rate they impact with a dependency link.
          Here is an example of an updated system diagram for the coffee cup example.

        <p>
            Working with parameters is important because it allows us to analyze multiple different models at once. 
            For example, suppose we are interested in installing solar panels as an energy source for our home. 
            We will use the stock-flow model represented by the system diagram below.
        </p>

                A system diagram for the amount of energy stored in solar panels, with an inflow from the sun, 
                outflow from energy use, and a parameter of the panels' area which impacts the inflow rate from the sun.
            </caption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The coverage area of the solar panels is a parameter because it is a constant once we install them, 
            but it impacts the inflow rate of energy that we receive from the sun. We would like to determine the value 
            of this parameter that results in an equilibrium value of <m>0</m> for our stock.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose that the outflow rate of energy from the panels is constant at <m>1,400</m> watts. 
            The inflow rate (<m>R</m>) from the sun is dependent on both the amount of energy in the panels (<m>E</m>), 
            measured in watt-hours (Wh), and the area of the panels (<m>A</m>), measured in square meters, according to the 
            equation 
            <me>R= \frac{A(1,000 - E)}{2}</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also know that the stock is in equilibrium when the inflow rate is equal to the outflow rate, 
            or as an equation, when
        
            <me>1,400 = \frac{A(1,000 - E)}{2}</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike in the last section, our equation has two unknown quantities, <m>A</m> and <m>E</m>. But we also know 
            that we'd like the equilibrium value to be <m>E=0</m>. Substituting this value into our equation gives 
            <me>1,400 = \frac{A \cdot 1,000}{2}</me>,
            which can be solved to find that <m>A=2.8</m> square meters. Using the parameter <m>A</m> in our analysis helps 
            us make an educated decision about the solar panels in order to achieve a certain behavior from the system.
