        <title>Course Textbook and Materials</title>
        <p>
            This course has no required textbook, though the content organization is modeled after the text 
            <url href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-76660-7">Mathematics for Sustainability</url>, 
            which can be downloaded for free using your Colorado State University login credentials. 
            You will be asked to reference this text for <xref ref="p-case-studies" text="custom">case studies</xref>, and you may find 
            it useful as a supplemental resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use <url href="https://canvas.colostate.edu/">Canvas</url> to organize grades. The link to the text you
            are currently reading can be found in our Canvas course. We will utilize 
            <url href="https://www.doenet.org/">Doenet</url> for section checkpoint questions after each 
            <xref ref="p-activities" text="custom">course activity</xref>. 
            Both Canvas and Doenet can be accessed using your Colorado State University email. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are invested in making all course materials as <url href="https://www.colostate.edu/accessibility-statement/">
                accessible</url> as possible. If you experience any barriers to access,
            please communicate with me so that we can make improvements.

        <title>Course Content and Structure</title>
        <p>
            The first segment of our course will establish a broad range of mathematical tools which can be useful for 
            analyzing questions in sustainability. We do so in six sub-contexts which describe the actions that math can 
            help us perform or model: measuring, flowing, connecting, changing, risking, and deciding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second segment of the course is spent applying and extending these tools through 3 student-directed case 
            studies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The course structure emphasizes active learning and a collaborative work environment, which is outlined in more 
            detail in our <xref ref="pref-expectations" text="custom">expectations document </xref>.

        <title>Activities</title>
        <p>
            The first segment of class will be spent exploring content through in-class group activities, which are provided
            in this text. Activities contain examples, important definitions, practice problems, and concept questions to 
            help you actively engage with the material. You will receive credit for completing the activities, 
            responding to prompts in an individual portfolio, and participating in group and class discussions. 
            Detailed expectations are outlined in our <xref ref="pref-expectations" text="custom">expectations document </xref>.

    <paragraphs xml:id="p-case-studies">
        <title>Case Studies</title>
        <p>
            The second segment of class will be spent reviewing, preparing, and presenting case studies on topics in 
            sustainbility. Case studies will be completed in groups, and you will be given guidelines that encourage you 
            to use and expand on tools that were learned in the first segment of the course. There will be a total of three 
            case studies, graded out of <m>30</m> points each. A detailed rubric is provided in <xref ref="ch-case-studies"/>.

        <title>(Optional) Pre-Calculus Placements</title>
        <p>
            The course does not serve as a prerequisite into any other math course. However, if you would like to earn 
            placement out of specific pre-calculus courses, you will be given the opportunity to do so. At the beginning of 
            the course, you will be asked to set any placement goals that you have for the semester. It will be your 
            responsibility to study the relevant material for your goals outside of class, and visit office hours to 
            practice and ask questions. We will then have two opportunities for you to take placement assessments: once 
            between the first and second segments of our course, and once after the second segment of our course (finals week).

        <title>Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion</title>
        <p>
            Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. 
            Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and 
            sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, 
            color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and 
            gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the 
            student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. 
            Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. 
            For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at 
            <url href="https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/policies/students-responsibilities/">the catalog</url>

            We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of 
            mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. 
            We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you 
            can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are 
            committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the 
            hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, 
            and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.

        <title>Religious Observances and Class Attendance</title>
        <p>
        CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, 
        it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each 
        semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students 
        will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how 
        best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be 
        anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the 
        course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple 
        conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer 
        taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may 
        appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure 
        compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at

        <title>Discrimination and Harassment</title>
        <p>
            CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. 
            CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that 
            each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations 
            such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are 
            prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, 
            domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under 
            the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having 
            business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.

        <title>Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</title>
        <p>
            We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. 
            However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if 
            you crossed the line, ask yourself "Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look 
            like this?" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements 
            from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously,
            so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.
        </p>
        <p>
            This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General 
            Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course 
            and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at
