    <title>Networks and Graphs</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          We live in a very connected world. From social interactions to predator-prey relationships, connections have a 
          large impact on how systems behave. The purpose of this activity is to introduce an important mathematical tool 
          used to model network connections.

            A <term>network</term> is a set of entitities which have a rule that defines when two entities in the set are 
            related. This is a very broad concept which arises in various contexts. For example, a network may consist of a 
            set of twenty neighborhoods (call them A through T), with the rule that two neighborhoods are related if there 
            is a road that connects them.

        <p>
            Mathematically, we can represent networks with <term>graphs</term>. Though you may have heard this term in a 
            math class previously, it is likely different than what you are picturing. Below is an example of a graph of the 
            neighborhood network we described above.

                A graph whose vertices, labeled A through T, represent neiborhoods, and whose edges represent roads 
                connecting neighborhoods.

                        A graph can also be represented by giving a set of coordinate pairs. Two vertices are listed as a 
                        pair if there is an edge between them. The graph above would be represented as coordinate pairs 
                        as follows:

        <p>
            Let's make some important observations about graphs using this example:
        
          <ol>
            <li>
                An entity (in this example, a neighborhood) is represented by a point called a <term>vertex</term>. 
                Two entities are related (in this example, there is a road connecting two neighborhoods) if they are connected 
                by a line called an <term>edge</term>. If two vertices are connected by an edge, we call them 
                <term>neighbors</term>. 
                <remark>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that this graph communicates nothing about the actual physical location of each 
                        neighborhood. You can move the vertices anywhere you wish (try it!), and it would still be the same graph. 
                        The graph communicates only which entities are in the network, and how they are related to each other.
                    </p>
                </remark>
            </li>
            <li>
                The number of edges coming from one vertex is called the <term>degree</term> of that vertex. For example, 
                the degree of vertex A is <m>4</m>, and the degree of vertex S is <m>1</m>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A <term>path</term> between two verices is a sequence of edges that connects one vertex to the other. 
                A graph is <term>connected</term> if there is a path between any two verices. Otherwise, it is 
                <term>disconnected</term>. For example, the graph of above is disconnected because there is no path from 
                vertex M to vertex A. However, the graph obtained by ommitting vertices K through O is connected, as is the 
                graph consisting of only vertices K through O. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A graph can be useful for making qualitative observations about a network. For example, while there is no 
                path from vertices K through O to other vertices, they are highly connected to each other. Also, vertices 
                A, J, and T seem to be structurally important neighborhoods. There are many roads connecting them to other 
                neighborhoods (they have a high degree), and if we got rid of them, many more neighborhoods would become 
                disconnected. We'll make these ideas more precise in the next section.

        <p>
            There are variations of graphs that can be obtained by adding additional structure based on the needs of your model. 
            We present one such variation here due to its connection with our topic from <xref ref="ch-02"/>.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>directed graph</term> is a graph whose edges have a specified direction. 
                That is, there are two different edges that could connect vertices A and B: the edge AB (<q>A to B</q>) 
                and the edge BA (<q>B to A</q>).
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The visual difference in directed graphs is that the edges are represented by arrows, which provide the 
            additional information of direction. For example, directed graphs can be used to represent predator-prey 
            relationships within an ecosystem. Take a moment to interpret the directed graph below in your group.

                        A directed graph can also be represented by giving a set of ordered coordinate pairs. 
                        Two vertices are listed as a pair if there is an edge going from the first listed vertex to
                        the second. The graph above would be represented as ordered coordinate pairs as follows:
                    </p>

                        (Rabbit, Vegetation), (Mouse, Vegetation), (Grasshopper, Vegetation),

        </figure>
        <p>
            Another example of directed graphs are the system diagrams that we've been using to visualize stock-flow models. 
            The vertices of such a graph are the stocks, rate-controlling processes, sources/sinks, and parameters in the 
            model, while the directed edges are the inflow/outflow arrows and the dependency links. 
            Here is an example from <xref ref="sec-2-4"/>:

                On the left, the stock-flow model for the energy in solar panels is represented by a system diagram. 
                On the right, the model is represented as a directed graph.
                <remark><title>Edges Listed as Ordered Pairs</title>
                    <p>
                        The directed edges listes as ordered pairs for this graph would be as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Area, Sun), (Sun, Energy), (Energy, Sun), (Energy, Energy Use), (Energy Use, Sink)

            Note that the system diagram provides additional context about the model that, in many cases, can be useful.
