    <title>Resilience</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            It is important to acknowledge that our systems are susceptible to changes that we may not be able to predict. 
            Operating systems fail, natural disasters occur, and relationships end. Therefore, an important consideration in 
            questions of sustainability is that of resilience: to what extent is a system able to continue functioning after 
            sudden or unexpected damage? The purpose of this activity is to introduce two properties that we can compute to 
            quantify the resilience of a network modeled as a graph.

            <q>Resilience</q> can reference various things in science and daily life. In this section, we use the term 
            <q>resilience</q> as a measure of how connected a network is: to what extent can a network continue to function 
            as intended in the midst of network connection failures? A specific class of graphs, which we define now, 
            will be important in our discussion.

                A <term>complete graph</term> is a graph in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.

        <p>
            From the perspective of connectivity, complete graphs are as connected as a graph can be. Below are examples of 
            complete graphs on <m>3</m>, <m>4</m>, and <m>5</m> vertices, respectively.

            An intuitive way to describe how connected a network is would be to measure how closely the graph that 
            represents it resembles a complete graph. One such measurement is called the <term>density</term> of the graph.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>density</term> of a graph <m>G</m> is the ratio
                <me>\rho(G) = \frac{\text{number of edges of }G}{\text{number of possible edges}}</me>.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The density of a graph will be a number between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, which can be thought of as the percentage 
            of possible edges that the graph contains. Since we previously found a formula for the number of edges the 
            complete graph with <m>n</m> vertices contains, the density of a graph <m>G</m> with <m>n</m> vertices can be 
            re-written as 
            <me>\rho(G) = \frac{\text{number of edges of }G}{0.5n(n-1)}</me>.

            While a graph's density does give us some useful measure of how connected a graph is, we must be careful to 
            understand what this number does (and does not) tell us, and that we can rarely draw conclusions from this number 
            alone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, suppose graph <m>H</m> from above represents a signal network. The vertices are routers, and there 
            is an edge between two vertices if those two routers can share a signal. From our density computation of <m>0.7</m>, 
            it might be tempting to say that this network is <q>very connected</q>. But from the perspective of resilience, 
            how accurate is this statement? Most routers in the system could go down without impacting the ability of the other 
            routers to communicate with one another. However, there is one router (can you identify which one?) whose failure 
            would result in other routers being disconnected from one another. This is not ideal for resilient networks.
        </p>
        <p>
            The important thing to note here is that a graph's density is a <term>global</term> measurement. That is, it is a 
            number that says something about the graph's edges as a whole, but does not say anything about how they are 
            distributed throughout the graph (which ultimately will determine the resilience of a network in situations 
            such as the previous paragraph). In order to describe how edges are distributed throughout a graph, we need a 
            <term>local</term> measurement. That is, a number that describes a graph's edges near a specific vertex. 
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>clustering coefficient</term> of a vertex <m>v</m> is the ratio
                <me>\kappa(v) = \frac{\text{number of edges between neighbors of }v}{\text{number of possible edges between neighbors of }v}</me>.
                If the degree of <m>v</m> is one or zero, <m>\kappa(v)</m> is defined to be <m>0</m>.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The clustering coefficient of a vertex <m>v</m> will be a number between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, 
            which can be thought of as the percentage of possible edges that the neighbors of <m>v</m> contains. 
            Assuming the vertex <m>v</m> has degree <m>d</m>, and using the formula for the number of edges the complete g
            raph with <m>d</m> vertices contains, the clustering coefficient of <m>v</m> can be re-written as 
            <me>\kappa(v) = \frac{\text{number of edges of between neighbors of }v}{0.5d(d-1)}</me>.

        <p>
            The concept of a router failing and disconnecting other routers in the signal network example has a formal 
            definition in the context of graphs.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                The <term>vertex connectivity</term> of a graph is the minimum number of vertices whose removal 
                (along with their associated edges) would disconnect the graph.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The vertex connectivity of graph <m>H</m> from our previous examples is <m>1</m>, because there is a single 
            vertex that can be removed which disconnects the graph. There is also an analagous definition for the removal 
            of edges.

                The <term>edge connectivity</term> of a graph is the minimum number of edges whose removal would
