            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Let's practice creating graphs to represent networks. Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to 
                    recall the various components that comprise a graph. After you have created a graph, answer the 
                    following questions.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Which vertex in your graph has the highest degree?</li>
                        <li>Is your graph connected?</li>
                        <li>What do your previous answers mean in the context of your network?</li>
                    </ol>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    In your group, brainstorm three networks that you think would be best represented as a <em>directed</em> 
                    graph. Then pick one of these networks to create a directed graph for below. You may simplify the 
                    network or represent just part of the network to make this achievable in the timeframe available.
                </p>

                    Use the interactive as needed if it is helpful to 
                    recall the various components that comprise a directed graph.
