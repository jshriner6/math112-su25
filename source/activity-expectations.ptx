        <title>Groups and Group Roles</title>
        <p>
            You are expected to work on class activities in groups of <m>3</m> or <m>4</m>. The details of how groups should 
            be formed will be provided by your instructor. Within each group, individuals will fill one of the following roles:
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <alert>Reader.</alert> This role is responsible for leading the reading of the activity text, and leading 
                    group discussions when prompted by exercises within the activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <alert>Reporter.</alert> This role is responsible for recording summaries of group responses to questions, 
                    and should be prepared to communicate the group's ideas during class discussions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <alert>Time Keeper.</alert> This role is responsible for keeping the group on task to finish activity 
                    sections in the allotted time. If the group is stuck and spending too much time one thing, they may need to 
                    encourage the group to either write down questions for later, or to ask an instructor for help.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <alert>Mediator. (optional)</alert> This role is responsible for ensuring everyone in the group is 
                    understanding the objectives of the activity. This will include posing and writing down questions related 
                    to the objectives that can either be answered by group members or an instructor. If there are only three 
                    group members, this role can be filled by the Time Keeper.

            <title>Portfolio Entries</title>
            <p>
                Each activity will have exercises, parts of which will ask you to write things on paper. 
                The collection of paper that you keep your work in will be considered your <q>portfolio</q>, and you will be 
                asked to submit your portfolio at regular intervals throughout the class, determined by your instructor. 
                In order to receive credit for an activity, you must have a portfolio entry addressing all of the prompts 
                from that activitiy.

            <title>Section Checkpoints</title>
            <p>
                Most activities will have section checkpoint questions at the very end. You will not be graded on these for 
                accuracy, but they are very important in helping us assess mastery of the different objectives from each 
                section. In order to receive credit for an actiivty, you must complete all section checkpoint questions for 
                that activity.

            <p>
            If you miss an activity, you should complete the activity outside of class, including a portfolio entry, 
            and visit office hours within one week to review the activity with your instructor. After meeting with your 
            instructor, complete the section checkpoint questions.
