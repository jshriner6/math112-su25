    <title>Change and Estimation</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Measurements used in discussions of complex questions are often not exact, but estimates of some exact meansurement.
           The purpose of this activity will be to describe some common ways that measurements can be estimated so that you 
           understand these estimates when they are presented to you, and can create your own estimates to communicate to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The objectives of this activity are that you can...

        <p>
            In questions of sustainability, we are often dealing with measurements that change over time. 
            Therefore, it is important that we are able to describe this change. There are two main ways we could do this:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    We could describe the <term>absolute change</term>. For example, if a population is currently <m>1,000,000</m>
                    individuals, and a year later grows to to <m>1,000,100</m> individuals, we could say that the absolute 
                    change from one year to the next is <m>100</m> individuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We could describe the <term>relative change</term>. In the same example, we could say that the population 
                    grew by <m>0.01 \%</m>, since <m>100</m> is <m>0.01 \%</m> of the initial population of <m>1,000,000</m>.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this activity, we will focus on describing the relative change of measurements, since this generally is most 
            informative. Following our example above, if you told someone that the population grew by <m>100</m> individuals, 
            it is not clear how significant this growth is. Is <m>100</m>  a lot? a little? 
            That significance is clarified when we describe the relative growth as a percent of the initial population. 
            The growth of <m>100</m> individuals is very small compared to the initial population of <m>1,000,000</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can describe relative change using <term>percentages</term> or <term>pure number</term> multiples. 
            The following examples illustrate both of these methods:
              <ul>
                <li>
                    A bank account increased from <m>$ 200</m> to <m>$300</m>. It grew by <m>\frac{$300}{$200} = 1.5</m> times,
                     or by <m>50\%</m>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The mass of nitrogen in a soil sample decreased from <m>500</m> g to <m>400</m> g. 
                    It decreased by <m>\frac{400 \text{ g}}{500 \text{ g}} = 0.8</m> times, or by <m>20 \%</m>.
                </li>
              </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's make two general observations about these examples that we can use moving forward:
              <ol>
                <li>
                    Describing change using pure number multiples requires setting up the ratio 
                    <m>\frac{\text{new measurement}}{\text{old measurement}}</m>. 
                    The resulting number is unitless, and gives us the constant multiple of the old measurement that would 
                    result in the new measurement. A pure number multiple greater than <m>1</m> signifies the measurement 
                    increased, while a pure number multiple between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> signifies the measurement decreased.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Describing change using percentages can be obtained from a pure number multiple <m>P</m> as 
                    <m>(P-1)\cdot 100</m> for increasing measurments, or <m>(1-P)\cdot 100</m> for decreasing measurements. 
                </li>
              </ol>

        <p>
            Suppose you were told that the annual <m>\text{CO}_2</m> emmissions from a given country was <m>582,072,950</m> 
            tons. Would your interpretation of that measurement be significantly different if you instead were told that the 
            amount was <m>500,000,000</m> tons? These two measurement have the same <term>order-of-magnitude</term>, which can
            be a useful concept to understand for interpreting and creating estimates of very large or very small measurements.
            Watch this brief video as a group for an introduction to orders of magnitude.

            The power of <m>10</m> used when writing numbers in scientific notation is called the <term>order-of-magnitude</term>
            of that number. This is often the most usable part of a measurment for practical purposes, 
            and is also the best starting place for making estimates of measurements that have limited information. 
            We call an estimate of the form <q><m>1.0 \times 10^n</m></q> an <term>order-of-magnitude estimate</term>.

                        For 2024-25, the student count was <m>34,218</m>. The order of magnitude is <m>4</m>.

                        The average mass is roughly <m>62</m> kg. The order of magnitude is <m>1</m>.

                        The distance is roughly <m>105,000</m> m (<m>65</m> miles). The order of magnitude is <m>5</m>.

                        There's no clear answer for this one. How might you go about using your experience to make the best

                <li>
                    What is the order-of-magnitude of a number? Why is it useful to think about the order of magnitude of a 
                    measurement?
