            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Now let's practice describing the relative change of measurments. Choose new variations of the problem 
                    with the <q>New Variation</q> button.

                    First, let's practice using <term>scientific notation</term> to express very large or very small numbers

                    As a group, make order of magnitude estimates for the following measurements. Identify the order of
