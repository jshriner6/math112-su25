                            1930 to 2023. Information is displayed as discrete points, where the point's position in the horizontal
                            direction determines the year and the point's position in the vertical direction determines the natural gas
                            production in that year.
                            Production trends upward until about 1970, remains somewhat steady until about 2005, 
                            and then trends upward again.
