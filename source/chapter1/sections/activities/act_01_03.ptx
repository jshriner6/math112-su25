                    For each representation, answer the following questions.

                            1930 to 2023. Information is displayed as discrete points, where the point's position in the horizontal

                            production in that year.
                            Production trends upward until about 1970, remains somewhat steady until about 2005,

                        the type of data that you have, but also think about how you will design that representation. 
                        Looking at the examples above,
