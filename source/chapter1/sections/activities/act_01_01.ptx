                    Now let's practice choosing correct unit conversion factors. 
                    Choose new variations of the problem with the <q>New Variation</q> button.

                    Replace <q>number</q> with a correct number and <q>unit</q> with a correct unit abbreviation.
                    Enter your numbers without using commas. Choose new variations of the problem with the <q>New Variation</q> button.

                    While there is never one correct way to make extreme measurements more meaningful,
                     it is always helpful to frame them in a way that you think will be more relatable to someone's common experience! 
                     Let's practice that now.
