    <title>Representations</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Measurments are only useful if they help us to further our understanding, and can be communicated to others in an 
            impactful way. One of the most effective ways to understand and communicate measurements is through visual 
            representation. The purpose of this activity is to practice reading and representating measuremennts in an 
            organized, visual way.

    <objectives>
        <ol>
            <li>
                use tables to communicate quantitative information.                
            </li>
            <li>
                use graphical representations (line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts) to communicate 
                quantitative information.

            We will not spend time in this activity learning the various technologies that can be used to create visual 
            representations, but instead we will focus on making an appropriate choice of representation based on the data 
            we are representing, and the pattern(s) we would like to convey.

            While visual representations can be extremely useful for communicating patterns in large amounts of data, 
            they are also vulnerable to being used in ways that can be misleading. It's important to be careful to avoid 
            misleading visuals when creating your own representations, and to view visual representations that are presented 
            to you with a critical eye.

             Below is a comparison of the scatter plot presented in the previous exercise with the same section 
             on a standard scale:

                            A scatter plot displaying the U.S. natural gas production in millions of cubic feet during each 
                            year from 1986 to 2000. The vertical axis does not start at zero, which makes the upward trend 
                            look drastic.

        <p>
            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
          <ol>
            <li>
                When choosing a visual representation for your data, what are the main factors that you consider?
            </li>
            <li>
                In what ways can visual representations be misleading, and how can you analyze them to avoid being misled?
            </li>
