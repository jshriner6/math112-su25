    <title>Units</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          Units give measurements meaning. 
          If units are ignored or mis-used, this could lead us to make (at best) inaccurate or (at worst) harmful conclusions. 
          The purpose of this activity will be to practice working with and communicating measurements that contain units.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objectives of this activity are that you can...

        <p>
          Partner up with someone and assign the roles of <q>Partner 1</q> and <q>Partner 2</q>.
          Have a discussion using the script below, <em>following the rule that the partner answering the question must give a numerical answer without units</em>.
          <dl>
            <li><title>Partner 1:</title>
              "How far do you live from campus?"
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 2:</title>
              (Provide a numerical answer without units)
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 2:</title>
              "What's a normal temperature in your hometown right now?"
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 1:</title>
              (Provide a numerical answer without units)
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 1:</title>
              "How much weight would you be comfortable lifting over your head?"
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 2:</title>
              (Provide a numerical answer without units)
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 2:</title>
              "What's the longest distance you've ever run?"
            </li>
            <li><title>Partner 1:</title>
              (Provide a numerical answer without units)
            </li>
          </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          How much have you learned about your partner from their responses to these questions?
          Now use the script again, but provide units with your numerical answers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Units give measurements meaning, so it is important that we have tools to work with and understand them.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>unit conversion factor</term> is a ratio of numbers with units in which the numerator and denominator express the same quantity.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
          Take a moment to verbalize with your group why each of the following are examples of unit conversion factors, and any other observations or questions you have: 
            <me>\frac{1 \text{ foot}}{12 \text{ inches}}, \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ foot}}, \frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ m}}, \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5280 \text{ feet}}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unit conversion factors are used to convert a measurement in some unit to the same measurement in a different unit. For example, if I measured my height in inches to be <m>75</m> inches but I wanted to know my height measured in the units of feet, I could compute 
          <me>
            \require{cancel}
            75 \text{ in} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}} = \frac{75 \cdot 1}{12} \frac{\cancel{\text{in}} \cdot \text{ft}}{\cancel{\text{in}}} = 6.25 \text{ ft}
          </me>
          Let's take a moment to notice a few important things about this calculation:
          <ol>
            <li>
              My goal was to convert from inches to feet. Therefore, I needed to use a conversion factor relating these two units: 
              <m>\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}}</m>
            </li>
            <li>
              When doing a computation with numbers and units, I can treat the number parts and unit parts separately. 
              Gather all the numbers together with multiplication and division, and gather all the units together with multiplcation and division. 
              Units can cancel just like numbers!
            </li>
            <li>
              When converting from inches to feet, I have a choice between using 
              <m>\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}}</m> or <m>\frac{12 \text{ in}}{1 \text{ ft}}</m>. 
              Knowing that units can cancel each other out helps me pick the correct form of the converstion factor, 
              <m>\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}}</m>. In general, you will always want to set up the conversion factor 
              so that the unit you are converting <em>from</em> is in the <em>denominator</em>, and the unit you are converting <em>to</em> is in the <em>numerator</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Why does multiplying <m>75 \text{ in}</m> by <m>\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}}</m> not change the value of my original measurement? 
              Remember that <m>1 \text{ ft} = 12 \text{ in}</m>, so multiplying a number by <m>\frac{1 \text{ ft}}{12 \text{ in}}</m> 
              is the same as multiplying by <m>1</m>, which does not change its value.
            </li>

      <title>Back to work...</title>
      <p>
        At times we encounter measurements that are so extreme that it can be difficult to process them in a meaningful way. In these cases, it is useful to be able to frame the measurements in a way that is more relatable to our human experience. In what follows, you will get practice using unit conversions to communicate extreme measurements in a meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, let's say you're told that that the weight of the garbage deposited in your state's landfills in a calendar year was <m>7.9</m> million tons (<url href="https://coloradosun.com/2018/09/17/where-does-colorados-trash-go/">this was true of Colorado in 2016!</url>). How much trash is this, really? We could pick something for comparison that we believe is common to most people's experience, like a school bus. We can then attempt to convert the measurement of <m>7.9</m> million tons to the more relatable unit of <q>school buses</q>. So we'd like to convert from units of <q>tons</q> to units of <q>school buses</q>.  
      </p>
      <p>While weights of school buses vary, taking an approximate weight of an average school bus will be sufficient towards making this weight more meaningful. We will use the average school bus weight as <m>25,000</m> pounds. This gives us a unit conversion factor of
        <me>
          \frac{1 \text{ school bus}}{25,000 \text{ pounds}}
        </me>.
         This doesn't give us a single unit conversion factor relating <q>tons</q> and <q>school buses</q>, but we can convert <q>tons</q> to <q>pounds</q> (<m>1 \text{ ton}= 2,000 \text{ pounds}</m>), and then <q>pounds</q> to <q>school buses</q>. As a computation, it looks like this: 
        <me>
          \require{cancel}
          7.9 \text{ million}\cancel{\text{ tons}} \cdot \frac{2,000 \cancel{\text{ pounds}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ ton}}} \cdot \frac{1 \text{ school bus}}{25,000 \cancel{\text{ pounds}}} = 0.632 \text{ million school buses}
        </me>,
        or equivalently <m>632,000</m> school buses! That's a lot of trash!

        <p>
          Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Why are units in measurements important?
            </li>
            <li>
              Your friend wants to convert their weight from <q>pounds</q> to a unit called <q>stone</q>. 
              What information would you tell them they need in order to do so? How would you tell them to use that information to accurately convert their weight from pounds to stone?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are properties of a measurement that make it meaningful to you?
