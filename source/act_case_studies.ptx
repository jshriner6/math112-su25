                   You will first need to make an individual decision for where you would like to source your topic for your 
                   case study. You will then be placed into a group based off of this decision. Your options are as follows.
                   <ol>
                        <li>
                            If this is your first case study for the course, you will pick one of the studies from chapter 7 in 
                            the <url href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-76660-7">Mathematics for Sustainability</url> 
                            textbook. You can access this text for free by logging in with your CSU credentials.

                            textbook, or you can choose a topic from CSU Spur's

                            If this is your third case study for the course, you can choose a topic from CSU Spur's 
                            <url href="https://csuspur.org/csu-impacto/">CSU Impacto</url>, or you can pick a topic of your 
                            choosing. Your topic should be motivated by a data set that already exists (such as from

                            <p>
                                We have scheduled a time to practice our presentation as a group before our presentation day.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We have checked our final presentation against the final presentation rubric and feel 
                                confident that our work will meet our goals for our final score.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                We do not have any questions about the logistics (e.g., projecting a PowerPoint or other 
                                use of technology) of how we will present.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
