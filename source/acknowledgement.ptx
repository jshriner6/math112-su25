    <p>
     The general content organization is modeled after the text 
     <url href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-76660-7">Mathematics for Sustainability</url>, by John Roe, 
     Russ deForest, and Sara Jamshidi.
    </p>
    <p>
    The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of 
    the original Mathbook XML, now known as <url href="https://pretextbook.org/" visual="pretextbook.org">PreTeXt</url>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The interactive components were made possible by utilizing <url href="https://www.doenet.org/">Doenet</url>. I'm thankful
    to Duane Nykamp and the many contributors from the mathematics community for their work on this resource.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, I am grateful to Steve Benoit for providing valuable input and feedback throughout the process of developing the course
    and its resources.
