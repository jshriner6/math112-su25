    <title>The Logistic Model</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          In the last section we discussed linear flow rates, and the specific cases which result in exponential 
          behavior of a stock over time. It is possible for flow rates to be non-linear, which in general result in more 
          complicated stock behavior. The purpose of this activity is to introduce a common non-linear flow rate, and tools 
          for analyzing the behavior of these models.

        <p>
            In the previous section we introduced exponential models, which arise when the net flow rate for a stock is 
            linear (and not constant). There is a certain level of simplicity to these models because 
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    There is always a single equilibrium value for the stock (when the linear net flow rate is equal to <m>0</m>), 
                    and
                </li>
                <li>
                    The overall feedback is always either amplifying or stabilizing (depending on whether the linear net flow 
                    rate increases or decreases as the the stock value increases).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            These observations are illustrated in <xref ref="fig-net-flow-linear"/>.

                Two line graphs showing the relationship between net flow and stock value.
                The graph on the left is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of <m>3</m>, and the overall 
                feedback is always amplifying. The graph on the right is for a stock that has a single equilibrium value of 
                <m>4</m>, and the overall feedback is always stabilizing.

        <p>
            If we consider flow rates that are not linear, these observations are no longer true. In general, 
            there could be multiple equilibrium values of the stock, and the overall feedback affect may depend on the 
            stock's value. While this makes the model more complicated, these complexities may be desired in order to obtain 
            a more accurate model.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's consider modeling a population that is increasing over time. A good first model would be to use an 
            amplifying exponential model, such as <m>\text{Net Flow} = 2P</m>. This does a nice job at capturing the 
            tendency for reproduction (Net Flow) to increase with an increase in Population (P). Depending on the purpose 
            of your model, however, there may be one large flaw. With a positive initial value, this is an amplifying 
            exponential model which is increasing, and the line graph for the population over time would look something 
            like <xref ref="fig-exp-growth"/>.

        <p>
            While the pattern of increase may be accurate at first, this graph shows that the population will continue to 
            increase more and more rapidly without end. It does not account for factors such as limited resources, 
            which at some point should start to have a stabilizing affect on the population. The logistic model takes this 
            into account.

                A stock-flow model follows a <term>logistic model</term> if the net flow rate of the stock <m>S</m> has 
                the form
                <me>\text{Net Flow } = rS\left(1-\frac{S}{C}\right)</me>.
                The constant <m>r</m> represents the growth rate of the stock when the stock value is very small. 
                The constant <m>C</m> represents the carrying capacity (the maximum population that the environment can sustain).
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Note that while the logistic model has an amplifying factor (<m>rS</m>), it also has a stabilizing 
            factor <m>\left(1-\frac{S}{C}\right)</m>. That is, as <m>S</m> increases, <m>rS</m> also increases, 
            but <m>\left(1-\frac{S}{C}\right)</m> decreases. We'll analyze the overall affect of these competing factors now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose we have a stock-flow model of a population <m>P</m> with a single inflow of 
            <m>0.5P\left(1-\frac{P}{100}\right)</m>, and no outflow. That is, the population's net flow rate is 
            <me>\text{Net Flow } =0.5P\left(1-\frac{P}{100}\right)</me>.
            The growth rate when the population is very small is <m>0.5</m>, and the carrying capacity of this population is
             <m>100</m> individuals. The net flow rate is non-linear, and the graph of the net flow rate with respect to the 
             population (stock) value is given in <xref ref="fig-net-flow-logistic"/>.

            Our final goal will be to sketch a qualitatively accurate line graph of a stock's value over time whose behavior 
            is directed by the logistic model.

            We now have all the pieces needed to sketch a graph of a population over time which follows a logistic model. 
            Let's start with the example from <xref ref="fig-net-flow-logistic"/>, whose net flow was given by 
            <m>\text{Net Flow }=0.5P\left(1-\frac{P}{100}\right)</m>. You'll want to reference the graph in the figure for the
            next activity.

    <remark><title>Note on Carrying Capacity</title>
        <p>
            Do you wonder where the carrying capacity for a population comes from? It's possible to estimate this capacity 
            with some initial measurements of a stock's value over time. If this is something you are interested in 
            determining as part of a case study, please ask!
