    <introduction>
        <p>
            There is a particular dependency link relationship that occurs frequently in real-world systems. The purpose of 
            this activity is to understand the behavior of stocks whose flow rates have this type of dependency.

            A very common behavior exhibited of stocks in many systems (at least for a period of time) is 
            <em>exponential behavior</em>. To understand this behavior, let's look at some examples of measurements over 
            time that behave this way, and review calculating <term>absolute change</term> and <term>relative change</term> 
            from <xref ref="sec-1-2"/>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine that <xref ref="tab-ch4-exp-growth"/> is a measurement of a population (in millions of individuals) 
          after <m>t</m> years.

                An <term>exponential relationship</term> is a relationship whose relative change during any single unit 
                of time is constant. If the constant relative change is greater than one, we call it 
                <term>exponential growth</term>. If the the relative change is between zero and one, we call it 
                <term>exponential decay</term>.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            As we saw in the table calculuations above, exponential relationships can be good for describing models 
            that either
        
            <ul>
              <li>Increase or decrease very rapidly, or</li>
              <li>Increase or decrease very gradually.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A <term>transformation</term> of a line graph is a new line graph obtained from stretching, shifting, or 
            reflecting the original line graph. Since transformations of exponential relationships still exhibit the 
            general properties described above, we will also refer to transformations of exponentials relationships as 
            exhibiting exponential behavior. It will be useful to be able to visualize the line graphs representing this 
            behavior.

      <paragraphs><title>Back to work...</title>
        <p>
            Now we will look at how exponential relationships arise in stock-flow models. Suppose we have a stock 
            <m>S</m> with a single inflow of <m>2S</m> units per second. If we assume an initial stock value of <m>100</m> 
            units, then after the first second we would have an inflow of <m>2\cdot 100 =200</m> units, meaning our total 
            stock after the first second would be <m>300</m> units. If we continue to take measurements after each 
            second<fn>Note that we are treating this as a discrete system, in which measurements are taken at equally 
            spaced time intervals. This is opposed to a continuous system, in which measurements are taken continuously 
            over a time interval.</fn>, we would have the measurements recorded in <xref ref="tab-ch4-exp-stock"/> after the 
            first four seconds.

          <p>
            This table should remind us of <xref ref="tab-ch4-exp-growth"/> that we analyzed earlier: the stock's value is 
            increasing rapidly, but if we compute the relative change between each time interval we get the constant <m>3</m>. 
            The inflow to this stock increases in an exponential way! This behavior is the result of the constant 
            multiplication of the stock's value <m>S</m> by the factor <m>2</m>. Any flow rate of the form <m>cS</m>, 
            where <m>c</m> is a non-zero constant, will result in exponential behavior of the stock's value. 
            If the flow rate has the form <m>cS+b</m>, where <m>b</m> is a non-zero constant, this will result in a 
            transformation of exponential behavior. Because of this, we give flow rates of this form a special name.
          </p>
          <definition>

                If a stock <m>S</m> has a flow rate of the form <m>cS+b</m>, where <m>c</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, 
                we say that flow rate is <term>linear</term>.
            </p>
          </definition>
          <p>
            As we've just seen, linear flow rates in which the constant <m>c</m> is non-zero result in exponential behavior 
            of a stock's value. We saw in the previous section that it is the net flow rate of a stock that determines a 
            stock's behavior over time, so the following fact is relevant.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>If a stock's inflow and outflow rates are linear, then its net flow rate is also linear.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's return to our example of the stock <m>S</m> with inflow rate <m>2S</m>, and suppose also there is a single 
            outflow of <m>3S-6</m> units per second. Then the net flow rate for the stock is 
          </p>
          <me>2S-(3S-6) = -S+6 \text{ units per second}</me>.
          <p>
            It is important to note that the negative sign in front of <m>S</m> does not mean that the net flow is 
            always negative! It depends on <m>S</m>:
          
              <ul>
                <li>If <m>S=5</m>, the net flow will be positive.</li>
                <li>If <m>S=7</m>, the net flow will be negative.</li>
                <li>If <m>S=6</m>, the net flow will be <m>0</m>. That is, the stock is in equilibrium.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where it is helpful to have a line graph of the net flow rate with respect to the stock's value. 
            In our example this would produce a graph that looks familiar from 
            <xref ref="sec-4-1"/>:

            <ol>
                <li>
                    What are the characteristics of a stock that changes exponentially over time?

                    How do you know when feedback loops will result in exponential behavior of a stock?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you know when exponential behavior will be stabilizing or amplifying? What's the difference 
                    between these two types of behavior visually on a graph of the stock's value over time?
