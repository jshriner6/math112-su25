    <title>Equilibria and Stabililty</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
           We have discussed equilibrium values of a stock in various contexts, and have seen that they can be important 
           values for a system whether or not that system is in equilibrium. The purpose of this activity is to determine 
           how we can label an equilibrium value in a way that is descriptive of how the stock values behave around it.

            Imagine a system whose stock is currently in equilibrium. Then imagine some outside force nudging that stock 
            value out of equilibrium. How will the stock behave now? The answer to this question is what we will generally 
            refer to as the equilibrium value's <term>stability</term>. To start gaining an intutitve understanding of this 
            concept, work through the following thought exercise in your group.

            Your answers to the above questions are examples of the types of behavior we may see in real-world systems.  
            While the behavior of real-world systems can be much more complicated than what we've described so far, our 
            goal for this section will be to describe some common behaviors for the types of systems we've discussed in 
            previous sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recall from <xref ref="sec-4-1"/> the distinction between 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    continuous dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken continuously over time, and are visually 
                    represented by line graphs, and 
                </li>
                <li>
                    discrete dynamical systems, whose measurements are taken over equally spaced time intervals, and 
                    are visually represented by scatter plots. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            When analyzing the behavior of systems nudged out of equilibrium, it is important for us to distinguish between 
            these two types of models, as this can impact the types of behavior we can see.

                    An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 1 is called a <term>stable</term> equilibrium value. 
                    An equilibrium value that behaves like that of Stock 2 is called an <term>unstable</term> equilibrium value.

                The behavior around stable equilibrium values is reminiscent of the first system in 
                <xref ref="ws-4-4-1"/>, while the behavior around unstable equilibrium values is reminiscent of 
                the second system in <xref ref="ws-4-4-1"/>.

        <p>
            Now, we will explore stock behavior around equilibrium values in discrete dynamical systems. 
            Recall that the only difference in this context is that stock measurements are taken at equally spaced 
            intervals instead of continuously over time. There will be many similarities in the behavior that we saw 
            in the continous case, but also some differences. Let's work through some examples to explore the discrete 
            case in more detail. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the discrete case, because measurements are taken on a set interval, we have to be a bit more specific 
            than we were in the continuous case. It may not be sufficient to say that the stock is just increasing or 
            decreasing. We may need to describe in more detail by how much the stock is increasing or decreasing. We can use 
            the Net Flow rate information to help us do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, suppose the net flow rate for a stock <m>S</m> is given by <m>\text{Net Flow Rate}=2S-6</m> 
            units per minute, and we are taking stock measurements every minute. If the current stock value is <m>2</m> units, 
            than <m>2(2)-6 = -2</m> units will be added to <m>0</m> to get the new stock value after one minute. That is, if 
            the current stock value is <m>2</m> units, we can compute the next stock value after one minute with the 
            computation
        </p>
        <me>\underset{\text{Current Value}}{2 \text{ units}} + \underset{\text{Net Flow After 1 min}}{2(2) -6 \text{ units}} =\underset{\text{Next Value}}{0 \text{ units}} </me>
