                    The images below represent three different systems in equilibrium. 
                    The stock value being measured is the red ball's position in space, and since all three balls are 
                    balanced and not moving on their respective surfaces, each ball is in equilibrium. Now imagine that a 
                    gust of wind blows over each system.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the wind blows so that each ball moves just slightly to the right, describe how you think the ball will behave afterwards. </li>
                        <li>If the wind blows so that each ball moves just slightly to the left, describe how you think the ball will behave afterwards. </li>
                    </ul>
