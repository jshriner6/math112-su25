    <title>Dynamic Models and Feedback</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
          Real-world stocks are dynamic. They are constantly moving based on many factors within the system that contains it. 
          Sometimes that movement is less obvious than others, like when a stock is in equilibrium 
          (i.e., the stock value is constant). However, important sustainability questions arise when stock values change over time. 
          The purpose of this activity is to practice analyzing stock-flow models to determine common qualitative 
          behaviors of stock values that are changing.

        <p>
            We saw in <xref ref="sec-2-3"/> that flow rates in and out of a stock will often vary depending on the stock's 
            value. This is a critical factor which causes stock values to change over time, so we give it a special name.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                In a stock-flow model, a <term>feedback loop</term> is a process in which a stock's value changes the 
                behavior of a flow rate into or out of that stock.
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Using terminology from <xref ref="ch-02"/>, a feedback loop will exist whenever there is a dependency link 
            between a stock and flow rate into or out of that stock. In this chapter, we will think more carefully 
            about what that dependency link is, and how it impacts the behavior of the stock. Let's start with an example.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose that our stock is the amount of phosphorus in a lake, and that our model has two flows:
        
            <ol>
              <li>An outflow of of phosphorus as water leaves the lake to a stream. This flow rate is proportional to the amount of phosphorus in the lake water (i.e., the more phosphorus in the water, the larger the outflow rate of phosphorus). </li>
              <li>An inflow of phosphorus as plants and algae decompose. Since phosphorus is a nutrient for plants and algae, this flow rate also increases as the amount of phosphorus in the lake water increases.
              </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            How the amount of phosporus changes is dependent on how flow rates are impacted by the stock's value, 
            which we described verbally. We can also represent this behavior in a system diagram:
        </p>

                A system diagram for the amount of phosphorus in a lake including feedback loops involving the inflow of 
                phosphorus from plants and algae, and the outflow of phosphorus due to lake drainage.
            </caption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Let's make some important observations about this new diagram.
        
            <ol>
              <li>
                We've added plus signs to the dependency links to indicate that an increase in the amount of 
                phosphorus would increase both the inflow and outflow rates. In general, if an increase in the 
                stock causes a flow rate to increase, we add a <q><m>+</m></q> to that dependency link. 
                If an increase in the stock causes a flow rate to decrease, we add a <q><m>-</m></q> to that dependency link.  
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                These dependency links form two different feedback loops which are different in nature. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                  The feedback loop between the plants/algae rate and the phosphorus stock is called <term>amplifying</term>, 
                  because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the inflow rate to increase, which further increases 
                  the amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is amplifying if an increase in the stock value 
                  causes the flow rate to change in a way that further reinforces the increase of the stock's value. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  The feedback loop between the lake drain rate and the phosphorus stock is called <term>stabilizing</term>, 
                  because an increase in the phosphorus amount causes the outflow rate to increase, which decreases the 
                  amount of phosporus. In general, a feedback loop is stabilizing if an increase in the stock value 
                  causes the flow rate to change in a way that counteracts the stock's value from further increasing.

        <p>
            In <xref ref="sec-1-3"/> we saw the usefulness of communicating measurements with visual representations. 
            When analyzing stock-flow models, it is often helpful to use graphs which display a stock's value over time. 
            The type of graph that is used will depend on the nature of the dynamic model that we are using. 
            There are two main types of models.
        </p>
        <definition>
            <p>
                A <term>continuous dynamical system</term> is a system in which stock measurements are made continuously over a 
                time interval. A <term>discrete dynamical system</term> is a system in which stock measurements are made at 
                equally spaced time intervals (eg., a measurement is taken once every year).
            </p>
        </definition>
        <p>
            The visual representation of a stock value over time in a continuous dynamical system is a line graph, while the 
            visual representation of a stock value over time in a discrete dynamical system is a scatter plot. 
            This distinction is illustrated for a system which measures a population over time in 
            <xref ref="fig-cont-vs-discrete"/>
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-cont-vs-discrete">
            <interactive label="ch4-interactive-cont-vs-discrete" platform="doenetml" width="100%" aspect="2:1">
                <slate surface="doenetml">
                    <xi:include parse="text" href="doenet/ch4-doenet-cont-vs-discrete.doenetml"/>
                </slate>
            </interactive>
            <caption>
                On the left, the line graph of a population modeled as a continuous dynamical system. 
                On the right, a scatter plot of a population modeled as a discrete dynamical system. 
            </caption>
        </figure>

        <p>Unless stated otherwise, we will focus our analyses around continuous dynamical systems when sketching graphs of 
            stock values over time. In this section, we will begin to develop a strategy for translating system diagrams 
            for continuous systems to line graphs that describe the qualitative behavior of a stock over time 
            (like whether the stock is increasing or decreasing). In the next sections, we will develop line graphs in more 
            detail for some common types of models. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first example, let's consider a general system diagram of the following form:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-sys-diagram-amplifying">
            <interactive label="ch4-interactive-sys-diagram-amplifying" platform="doenetml" width="100%" aspect="3:1">
                <slate surface="doenetml">
                    <xi:include parse="text" href="doenet/ch4-doenet-sys-diagram-amplifying.doenetml"/>
                </slate>
            </interactive>
            <caption>
                A system diagram which contains one inflow and one outflow, both of which are part of amplifying feedback loops.
            </caption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The diagram indicates that an increase in stock increases the inflow, and an increase in stock decreases the 
            outflow. Both of these feedback loops are amplifying. How does a stock in such a system behave over time? 
            There is not a single answer to this question, but we can begin to answer it by remembering what 
            ultimately determines whether a stock value increases or decreases: 
        </p>
        <me>\text{net flow} = \text{total inflow}- \text{total outflow}</me>
        <p>
            The amplifying feedback loops tell us how the flow rates change as the stock value changes. As stock increases, 
            the inflow rate increases (<m>\nearrow</m>), and the outflow rate decreases (<m>\searrow</m>). so we can combine 
            this information to determine how the net flow rate changes as the stock value changes:
        </p>
        <me>\underset{\nearrow}{\text{total inflow}} - \underset{\searrow}{\text{total outflow}} </me>
        <p>
            An increase in the first number in the difference and a decrease in the second number in the difference both 
            cause the difference to increase. That is, as the stock value increases, the netflow increases. Here is an 
            example of representing such a relationship with a line graph:
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-net-flow-amplifying">
            <interactive label="ch4-interactive-net-flow-amplifying" platform="doenetml" width="100%" aspect="2:1">

                    <xi:include parse="text" href="doenet/ch4-doenet-net-flow-amplifying.doenetml"/>
                </slate>
            </interactive>
            <caption>
                A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. It shows that as the stock value 
                increases, so does the net flow rate.
            </caption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Take careful note of the axis labels: <q>Stock</q> and <q>Net Flow</q>. This visual shows us that as stock values 
            increase (as we move to the right on the horizontal axis), net flow values also increase 
            (we move up on the vertical axis). 
        </p>
        <p>
            This graph will prove to be extremely valuable in determining the behavior of the stock with respect to time, 
            and shows us that the behavior will be dependent on the stock's initial value. Let's consider a few cases.
            <ol>
                <li>
                  If the stock's initial value is <m>1</m>, then the graph shows us that the net flow will be negative. 
                  This meanse the stock will decrease. Since the net flow remains negative for stock values to the left of 
                  <m>1</m>, the stock will continue to decrease as time moves on.

                        A graph with stock on the horizontal axis and net flow on the vertical axis. 
                        It shows that if the stock value is one, the net flow will be negative, which means the stock will 
                        decrease from this initial stock value.

                  If the stock's initial value is <m>5</m>, then the graph shows us that the net flow will be positive. 
                  This meanse the stock will increase. Since the net flow remains positive for stock values to the r
                  ight of <m>5</m>, the stock will continue to increase as time moves on.

                  This means the stock is in equilibrium, so it's value will not change. The stock will continue to have
