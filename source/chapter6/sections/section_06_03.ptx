    <introduction>
        <p>
           Our decisions are never purely mathematical. As humans, the decisions we make are complex. The purpose of this 
           activity is to reflect on what it means for you to make a <q>good</q> decision in complicated circumstances, and 
           what role mathematics should have in that process.

            Our choices are multi-faceted. When faced with complicated questions, there are multiple factors that can be 
            taken into account. Some factors come from the facts involved, which is what we have spent much of our time 
            learning tools for analyzing so far. We may also consider personal beliefs that are important to us 
            (which we will refer to as <term>core values</term>), or basic principles that we believe should be a common 
            guide for our society (which we will refer to as <term>community ethics</term>).

      <conclusion><title>Reflection</title>
        <p>
            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    When thinking about different decisions you could make to a specific question in sustainability, 
                    how would you measure whether or not a decision is a <q>good</q> decision? Update the draft you've started 
                    today into a final draft that can help guide your approach to complex questions that you encounter in 
                    the future.
