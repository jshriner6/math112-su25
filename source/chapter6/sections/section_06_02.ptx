    <title>The Commons</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
           Many resources that are topics of sustainability can be used freely by many individuals. The purpose of this 
           activity is to understand possible outcomes when multiple individuals freely use a shared resource over time.

            A <term>commons</term> is any resource that is shared by a group and can be used freely by individuals in that 
            group. Our daily life is filled with examples of uses of commons, and these resources are also often at the 
            heart of sustainability questions.

        <p>
            We can view the management of a commons through the lens of game theory, where <q>players</q> are 
            individuals of the group using the resource, and the decision each player has is how much of the resource 
            they will use for themselves. We can do this through repeated games, where the decision to be made in a 
            single game is <q>should I use this resource again?</q>. The final outcome will be achieved when all players 
            decide they will stop using the resource. We will now use game theory tools to analyze outcomes when a 
            commons is managed by individuals making decisions according to the assumptions we outlined in  
            <xref ref="sec-6-1"/>.

            The <term>tragedy of the commons</term> refers to the phenomenon that occurs when individual rational choices 
            lead to an overuse of a shared resource that makes everyone worse off. Unfortunately, this is not a phenomenon 
            that is only observed in models. There are many examples of the tragedy of the commons in daily life, as well 
            as potential future examples. <fn><url href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/tragedy-of-the-commons-impact-on-sustainability-issues" visual="">Harvard Business</url></fn>
