            <introduction>
                <p>
                    In your group, brainstorm a list of as many resources as you can that would be considered a commons. 
                    Then discuss to what extent each resource on your list is relevant to sustainability.

            <title>Tragedy of the Commons</title>
    
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Suppose there are two farmers (the <q>players</q>) sharing an orchard (the commons). Each farmer can 
                    choose to plant a new fruit tree, which will deplete resources of the commons, but will also produce a 
                    fruit yield for the farmer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The yield of a single fruit tree depends on how many total trees are planted. If more trees are planted, 
                    there are fewer resources available to a single tree, so the yield of a single tree will decrease as more 
                    trees are planted. 
                </p>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    In your group, brainstorm some ideas for how you think the tragedy of the commons might be avoided.

                    The following are examples of approaches to avoiding the tragedy of the commons.
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <term>Privatization</term>. Make the commons no longer a shared resource. Divide the commons into parts, and give individuals ownership over those parts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             <term>Regulation</term>. Establish individual limits (legally or socially) on the use of the commons based on the social optimum use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <term>Cap and Trade</term>. Establish an upper limit on the overall use of the commons based on the social optimum use. Individuals can buy and trade permits for the use of the commons up to a specified level. The number of permits issued is limited to ensure the upper limit is not exceeded.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <term>Revenue-Neutral Use Tax</term>. Individual users of the commons pay a tax proportional to how much they use the commons. The tax is collected and then re-distributed evenly to all individuals using the commons.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
