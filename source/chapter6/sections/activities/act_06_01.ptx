            <title>Analyzing a Payoff Matrix</title>
    
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Suppose you and a classmate have a final project to complete. Half of this project is to be completed 
                    individually, while the other half of the project is to be completed jointly. You have to decide which 
                    part of the project you will prioritize over the next week, and you are not able to discuss your 
                    decision with your partner. Your decision has the following payoffs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you both work on the joint project, you will earn <m>\frac{50}{50}</m> for that portion, but only <m>\frac{30}{50}</m> for the individual portion. That is, your total grade will be <m>80\%</m>. </li>
                        <li>If one of you works on the joint project, but and the other works on the individual project, then the partner working on the individual project will earn <m>\frac{50}{50}</m> for the individual portion, and the partner working on the joint project will earn <m>\frac{20}{50}</m> for the individual portion. You both would earn <m>\frac{35}{50}</m> on the joint portion. So the partner working on the individual portion would earn an <m>85 \%</m>, while the partner working on the joint portion would earn a <m>55 \%</m>.  </li>
                        <li>If you both work on your individual projects, then you both will earn <m>\frac{50}{50}</m> for that portion, but only <m>\frac{25}{50}</m> for the joint portion. That is, your total grade will be <m>75\%</m>. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take a moment in your group to verify that this information is organized accurately in the following 
                    payoff matrix for this game.

                     Now we will practice more determining when a player in a game has a dominant choice, and using this to 
                     predict the outcome of the game. Two players can play a red card or blue card. The payoff matrix 
                     below shows the monetary payoff for every choice.

                   Suppose country A and country B share three polluted reservoirs. They each can make a decision as to which
