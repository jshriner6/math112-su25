    <introduction>
        <p>
           We've discussed several tools for analyzing data, predicting change, and assessing risk to better understand the 
           behavior of systems around us. Ultimately, we must use this information to make decisions. The purpose of this 
           activity is to introduce how mathematics can be used to help understand outcomes in a network of multiple 
           decision-makers.

        <p>
            <q>We must make a decision</q> can be a daunting phrase in many contexts. It is easy to think that the decision 
            itself is the complex part, requiring analysis of many factors and variables using tools such as we've discussed 
            up to this point. A goal of our final chapter is to consider the complexity introduced by <q>we</q>. Outcomes in 
            sustainability contexts are usually the result of decisions made by multiple connected individuals with varying 
            needs and values, not a decision made by a single individual. The <q>we</q> can range widely in scope, from a 
            school's decisions about how to re-use and re-cycle materials, to the world's decisions about how to respond to 
            current levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Regardless of the scope, outcomes resulting from 
            decisions made by a <q>we</q> are more complex to predict and understand than outcomes resulting from decisions 
            made by an individual. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most prevalent approaches that we have seen in modern history was introduced by economist Adam Smith 
            in 1776, describing an individual merchant:
        </p>
        <p>
            <q><em>...by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends 
                only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end 
                which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. 
                By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of society more effectually than when he really 
                intends to promote it.</em></q><fn>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, 
                    page 199</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
            This statement was made in the context of economics, but the philosophy is easily extended to any context which 
            involves multiple decision-makers, and provides one strategy and claim for sustainability decisions that involve 
            multiple individuals: if you, as an individual, regard only your own self-interest and all other individuals do 
            the same, then typically an unintended biproduct will be that the overall outcome is, in some sense, best for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            <term>Game theory</term> is a field of mathematics that can help us analyze scenarios in which there are 
            multiple decision-makers whose decisions affect each other. We will introduce the basic concepts here to 
            analyze in more detail the underlying philosophy in Smith's statement above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's begin with an example to introduce the important definitions. In the game <q>rock, paper, scissors</q>, 
            there are two players that make a choice of which element they'd like to play, and then they display those 
            elements simultaneously. The outcome of the game is determined by the following hierarchy:
        
          <ul>
            <li>rock beats scissors,</li>
            <li>scissors beats paper, and</li>
            <li>paper beats rock.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the players play the same object, the game would be considered a draw. If we were keep score, we could award a 
            <q><m>+1</m></q> for a win, a <q><m>-1</m></q> for a loss, and a <q><m>0</m></q> for a draw. We can organize all 
            possible outcomes for the game in the following table, where the entries are organized as 
            (Player A's payoff, Player B's payoff).

        <p>
            Let's make some important observations about this game.
          
          <ol>
            <li>
                This game contains more than one player, each of which is free to choose between multiple decisions, and each 
                player's satisfaction with the outcome depends on the decision made by the other player. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Each player has knowledge of every player's satisfaction with every possible outcome. In other words, each 
                player knows <xref ref="tab-ch6-payoff"/>, which is called the <term>payoff matrix</term> for the game. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Any situation containing the above elements is considered a <term>game</term>. Note that this is more general 
                than just the contexts that we typically think of as a <q>game</q>, like athletics or board games. For 
                simplicity, we will focus on two player games, which will simplify our analysis yet still allow us to make 
                some important observations about the outcomes of games.
            </li>
            <li> 
                If player A makes a choice, then a choice for player B which gives them the highest payoff given player A's 
                choice is called a <term>best response</term>. For example, if player A chooses <q>rock</q> 
                (so we are in the top row of the payoff matrix), a best response for player B is to choose <q>paper</q> 
                (<m>+1</m> is the best payoff in the second coordinate of the entries in row 1). An important part of 
                predicting the outcome of games will be to consider each player's best responses, and also their knowledge 
                of the the other player's best responses. We will assume that each player will act according to Smith's quote. 
                That is, each player will attempt to make a decision that is best for their own self-interst, and they know 
                the other player will do the same.   
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The rock, paper, scissors game also has the property that whatever one player gains, the other loses. 
            This is called a <term>zero sum</term> game. Let's look at another example of a game which is not a zero sum game.

            The outcome of the previous game is referred to as the <term>prisoner's dilemma</term>, because it is similar 
            to the game in which a team of prisoners is separated and they each have a choice of confessing the other's 
            crimes, or remaining silent. The payoff matrix for this game is as follows, with payoffs listed as years in prison.

            When at least one player has a single dominant choice, we can predict the outcome of the game. This is because 
            both players have knowledge of the payoff matrix. If player A has a dominant choice, then player B knows what 
            that is and knows that player A will choose it. Therefore, player B will make whatever choice is a best response 
            to player A's dominant choice.

            We will look at one more case when we are able to predict the outcome of a game. To help us do so, let's make an

            Let's make some important observations about these tables. 
          
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Organized this way, we can see that player B has a dominant choice of <q>Individual Project</q> because 
                    that is the only response listed in player B's best response column. The same is true for player A.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can also see that the of choice <q>Individual Project</q> for each partner is unique in another way: 
                    it is the only pair of choices which is a best response to the other. That is, if partner A chooses 
                    <q>Individual Project</q>, partner B's best response is <q>Individual Project</q>, and vice versa. 
                    A pair of choices with this property (that they are both best responses to the other) is called a 
                    <term>Nash equilibrium</term>.   
                </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Nash equilibria can occur even when neither player has a dominant choice. They are important to identify because 
            they are a combination of choices in which no player can benefit from making a different choice, assuming all 
            other players' choices stay the same. So if a game reaches a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to 
            make a different choice (this is why we refer to choices that meet this property as an <q>equilibrium</q>). 
            When there is a single Nash equilibrium in a game, we expect that players making decisions based only on their 
            own individual gain will make the choice corresponding to that equilibrium. Let's look at a final example.

          Outcomes of games with multiple Nash equilibria can depend on other factors relevant to the game. 
          Consider a game with two countries that share a single reservoir. They can choose to pollute the reservoir for 
          economic gain, or not. The payoff matrix showing the quality of life for each country is given below.

            Let's reflect on what we've learned, and what we still have questions about.
        
            <ol>
                <li>
                    What are the important assumptions in game theory that allow us to predict outcomes in many games?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What can game theory help us understand about outcomes in situations when there are multiple 
                    decision-makers?
                </li>
